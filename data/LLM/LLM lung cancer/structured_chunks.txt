Section: Tests for Lung Cancer

Some lung cancers can be found by screening, but most lung cancers are found because they are causing problems. The actual diagnosis of lung cancer is made by looking at a sample of lung cells in the lab. If you have possible signs or symptoms of lung cancer, see your doctor.

Section: Tests for Lung Cancer > Medical history and physical exam

Your doctor will ask about your medical history to learn about your symptoms and possible risk factors. They will also examine you to look for signs of lung cancer or other health problems.
If the results of your history and physical exam suggest you might have lung cancer, more tests will be done. These could include imaging tests and/or biopsies of the lung.

Section: Tests for Lung Cancer > Imaging tests to look for lung cancer

Imaging tests use x-rays, magnetic fields, sound waves, or radioactive substances to create pictures of the inside of your body. Imaging tests might be done for a number of reasons both before and after a diagnosis of lung cancer, including:
- To look at suspicious areas that might be cancer
- To learn how far cancer might have spread
- To help determine if treatment is working
- To look for possible signs of cancer coming back after treatment

Section: Tests for Lung Cancer > Imaging tests to look for lung cancer > Computed tomography (CT) scan

A CT scan uses x-rays to make detailed cross-sectional images of your body. Instead of taking 1 or 2 pictures, like a regular x-ray, a CT scanner takes many pictures and a computer then combines them to show a slice of the part of your body being studied.
A CT scan is more likely to find lung tumors than routine chest x-rays. It can also show the size, shape, and position of any lung tumors and can help find enlarged lymph nodes that might contain cancer that has spread. This test can also be used to look for masses in other parts of the body that might be due to the lung cancer spread.
CT-guided needle biopsy: If a suspected area of cancer is deep within your body, a CT scan might be used to guide a biopsy needle into this area to get a tissue sample to check for cancer.

Like CT scans, MRI scans show detailed images of soft tissues in the body. But MRI scans use radio waves and strong magnets instead of x-rays. MRI scans are most often used to look for possible spread of lung cancer to the brain, spinal cord, or liver.

Section: Tests for Lung Cancer > Imaging tests to look for lung cancer > Positron emission tomography (PET) scan

For a PET scan, a slightly radioactive form of sugar (known as fluorodeoxyglucose [FDG]) is injected into the blood and collects mainly in cancer cells. This is because cancer cells tend to take up more sugar (or glucose) than normal cells do.
PET/CT scan: Often a PET scan is combined with a CT scan using a special machine that can do both at the same time. This lets the doctor compare areas of higher radioactivity on the PET scan with a more detailed picture on the CT scan. This is the type of PET scan most often used in patients with cancer. PET/CT scans are used for cancer staging, which is to see if and where the cancer has spread. While they can be used to look at most organs in the body, they are not useful for looking at the brain or spinal cord.

Section: Tests for Lung Cancer > Tests to diagnose lung cancer

Symptoms and the results of certain tests may strongly suggest that a person has lung cancer, but the actual diagnosis is made by looking at lung cells in the lab.
The cells can be taken from a suspicious area using a needle or surgery (needle biopsy), fluid removed from the area around the lung (thoracentesis), or lung secretions (mucus you cough up from the lungs). The choice of which test(s) to use depends on the situation.

Section: Tests for Lung Cancer > Tests to diagnose lung cancer > Needle biopsy

Doctors often use a hollow needle to get a small sample from a suspicious area (mass). An advantage of needle biopsies is that they don’t require an incision. The drawback is that they remove only a small amount of tissue, and in some cases, the amount of tissue removed might not be enough to both make a diagnosis and to perform more tests on the cancer cells that can help doctors choose anticancer drugs. The main types of needle biopsies are: fine needle aspiration (FNA) biopsy and core needle biopsy (CNB).

Section: Tests for Lung Cancer > Tests to diagnose lung cancer > Needle biopsy > Fine needle aspiration (FNA) biopsy

A syringe with a very thin, hollow needle is used to withdraw (aspirate) cells and small fragments of tissue. FNA biopsy may be done to check for cancer in very small masses or in the lymph nodes located around the lungs. Transtracheal FNA or transbronchial FNA is done by passing the needle through the wall of the trachea (windpipe) or bronchi (the large airways leading into the lungs) during a bronchoscopy or endobronchial ultrasound (described below).
In some patients, an FNA biopsy is done during an endoscopic esophageal ultrasound (described below) by passing the needle through the wall of the esophagus.

Section: Tests for Lung Cancer > Tests to diagnose lung cancer > Needle biopsy > Core biopsy

---START CHUNK 17---
A larger needle is used to remove one or more small cores of tissue. Samples from core biopsies are often preferred because they are larger than FNA biopsies.

---START CHUNK 18---
Core biopsies can be done during many lung procedures and/or surgeries. One example would be during a Transthoracic needle biopsy, where the biopsy needle is put through the skin on the chest wall. The doctor guides the needle into the area while looking at the lungs with either fluoroscopy, which is like an x-ray, or a CT scan. A possible complication of this procedure is that air may leak out of the lung at the biopsy site and into the space between the lung and the chest wall. This is called a pneumothorax. It can cause part of the lung to collapse and sometimes cause trouble breathing. If the air leak is small, it often gets better without any treatment. Large air leaks are treated by inserting a chest tube (a small tube into the chest space), which sucks out the air over a day or two, after which it usually heals on its own.

Section: Tests for Lung Cancer > Tests to diagnose lung cancer > Thoracentesis

If fluid has collected around the lungs (called a pleural effusion), doctors can remove some of the fluid to find out if it is caused by cancer spreading to the lining of the lungs (pleura). The buildup might also be caused by other conditions, such as heart failure or an infection.
For a thoracentesis, the skin is numbed and a hollow needle is inserted between the ribs to drain the fluid. The fluid is checked in the lab for cancer cells. Other tests of the fluid are also sometimes useful in telling a malignant (cancerous) pleural effusion from one that is not.
If a malignant pleural effusion has been diagnosed and is causing trouble breathing, a thoracentesis may be repeated to remove more fluid which may help a person breathe better.

Section: Tests for Lung Cancer > Tests to diagnose lung cancer > Sputum cytology

A sample of sputum (mucus you cough up from the lungs) is looked at in the lab to see if it has cancer cells. The best way to do this is to get early-morning samples 3 days in a row. This test is more likely to help find cancers that start in the major airways of the lung, such as squamous cell lung cancers. It might not be as helpful for finding other types of lung cancer. If your doctor suspects lung cancer, further testing will be done even if no cancer cells are found in the sputum. This form of testing is not usually used unless the other methods are felt to be too dangerous for the patient.

If lung cancer has been found, it’s often important to know if it has spread to the lymph nodes in the space between the lungs (mediastinum) or other nearby areas. This is especially important for a person with early-stage lung cancer, and can affect  their treatment options. Several types of tests can be used to look for this cancer spread.

Section: Tests for Lung Cancer > Tests to look for lung cancer > Bronchoscopy

Bronchoscopy can help the doctor find tumors or blockages in the airways of the lungs, which can often be biopsied during the procedure.
Electromagnetic navigation bronchoscopy uses a bronchoscope to biopsy a tumor in the outer part of the lung. First, CT scans are used to create a virtual bronchoscopy. The abnormal area is identified, and a computer helps guide a bronchoscope to the area so that it can be biopsied. The bronchoscope used has some special attachments that allow it to reach farther than a regular bronchoscope. This takes special equipment and training.

Section: Tests for Lung Cancer > Tests to look for lung cancer > Mediastinoscopy and mediastinotomy

These procedures may be done to look more directly at and get samples from the structures in the mediastinum (the area between the lungs). The main difference between the two is in the location and size of the incision.
A mediastinoscopy is a procedure that uses a lighted tube inserted behind the sternum (breast bone) and in front of the windpipe to look at and take tissue samples from the lymph nodes along the windpipe and the major bronchial tube areas. If some lymph nodes can’t be reached by mediastinoscopy, a mediastinotomy may be done so the surgeon can directly remove the biopsy sample. For this procedure, a slightly larger incision (usually about 2 inches long) between the left second and third ribs next to the breastbone is needed.

Thoracoscopy can be done to find out if cancer has spread to the spaces between the lungs and the chest wall, or to the linings of these spaces. It can also be used to sample tumors on the outer parts of the lungs, as well as nearby lymph nodes and fluid, and to assess whether a tumor is growing into nearby tissues or organs. This procedure is not often done just to diagnose lung cancer, unless other tests such as needle biopsies are unable to get enough samples for the diagnosis. Thoracoscopy can also be used as part of the treatment to remove part of a lung in some early-stage lung cancers. This type of operation, known as video-assisted thoracic surgery (VATS), is described in Surgery for Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer.

---START CHUNK 30---
Lung (or pulmonary) function tests (PFTs) are often done after lung cancer is diagnosed to see how well your lungs are working. This is especially important if surgery might be an option in treating the cancer. Surgery to remove lung cancer may mean removing part or most of a lung, so it’s important to know how well your lungs are working beforehand. Some people with poor lung function (like those with lung damage from smoking) don’t have enough healthy lung to withstand removing even part of a lung. These tests can give the surgeon an idea of whether surgery is a good option, and if so, how much lung can safely be removed.
There are different types of PFTs, but they all basically have you breathe in and out through a tube that is connected to a machine that measures airflow.

---START CHUNK 31---
There are different types of PFTs, but they all basically have you breathe in and out through a tube that is connected to a machine that measures airflow.
Sometimes PFTs are coupled with a test called an arterial blood gas. In this test, blood is removed from an artery (instead of from a vein, like most other blood tests) so the amount of oxygen and carbon dioxide can be measured.

Section: Tests for Lung Cancer > Lab tests of biopsy and other samples

Samples that have been collected during biopsies or other tests are sent to a pathology lab. A pathologist will look at the samples and may do other special tests to diagnose and better classify the cancer. (Cancers from other organs also can spread to the lungs. It’s very important to find out where the cancer started, because treatment is different depending on the origin of the cancer.)
The results of these tests are described in a pathology report, which is usually available within a week. If you have any questions about your pathology results or any diagnostic tests, talk to your doctor. If needed, you can get a second opinion of your pathology report by having your tissue samples sent to a pathologist at another lab.
For more information, see Understanding Your Pathology Report.

---START CHUNK 35---
In some cases, especially for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), doctors may test for specific gene changes in the cancer cells, which could mean certain targeted drugs might help treat the cancer. For example:
- About 20% to 25% of NSCLCs have changes in the KRAS gene that cause them to make an abnormal KRAS protein, which helps the cancer cells grow and spread. NSCLCs with this mutation are often adenocarcinomas, resistant to other drugs such as EGFR inhibitors, and are most often found in people with a smoking history.
- EGFR is a protein that appears in high amounts on the surface of 10% to 20% of NSCLC cells and helps them grow. Some drugs that target EGFR can be used to treat NSCLC with changes in the EGFR gene, which are more common in certain groups, such as those who don’t smoke, women, and Asians. But these drugs don’t seem to be as helpful in patients whose cancer cells have changes in the KRAS gene.

---START CHUNK 36---
- About 5% of NSCLCs have a change in the ALK gene. This change is most often seen in people who don’t smoke (or who smoke lightly) and have the adenocarcinoma subtype of NSCLC. Doctors may test cancers for changes in the ALK gene to see if drugs that target this change may help them.
- About 1% to 2% of NSCLCs have a rearrangement in the ROS1 gene, which might make the tumor respond to certain targeted drugs.
- A small percentage of NSCLCs have changes in the RET gene. Certain drugs that target cells with RET gene changes might be options for treating these tumors.
- About 5% of NSCLCs have changes in the BRAF gene. Certain drugs that target cells with BRAF gene changes might be an option for treating these tumors.
- A small percentage of NSCLCs have certain changes in the MET gene that make them more likely to respond to some targeted drugs.

---START CHUNK 37---
- A small percentage of NSCLCs have certain changes in the MET gene that make them more likely to respond to some targeted drugs.
- In a small percentage of NSCLCs, the cancer cells have certain changes in the HER2 gene that make them more likely to respond to a targeted drug.
- A small number of NSCLCs have changes in one of the NTRK genes that make them more likely to respond to some targeted drugs.
These genetic tests can be done on tissue taken during a biopsy or surgery for lung cancer. If the biopsy sample is too small and all the studies cannot be done, the testing may also be done on blood that is taken from a vein just like a regular blood draw. This blood contains the DNA from dead tumor cells found in the bloodstream of people with advanced lung cancer. Obtaining the tumor DNA through a blood draw is called a liquid biopsy. Liquid biopsies are done in cases where a tissue biopsy is not possible or if a tissue biopsy is felt to be too dangerous for the patient.

Patients diagnosed with non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) will have the lung tumor cells tested for PD-L1. PD-L1 is a protein (program death ligand 1) on cancer cells. A score is calculated depending on “if” and “how much” PD-L1 protein the tumor is making. This score will guide decisions about whether the patient would benefit from certain immunotherapy drugs.

Section: Radiation Therapy for Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer > When is radiation therapy used?

Depending on the stage of the non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and other factors, radiation therapy might be used:
- As the main treatment (sometimes along with chemotherapy), especially if the lung tumor can’t be removed because of its size or location, if a person isn’t healthy enough for surgery, or if a person doesn’t want surgery
- After surgery (alone or along with chemotherapy) to try to kill any small areas of cancer that surgery might have missed
- Before surgery (usually along with chemotherapy) to try to shrink a lung tumor to make it easier to operate on
- To treat cancer spread to other areas, such as the brain or bone
- To relieve (palliate) symptoms of advanced NSCLC, such as pain, bleeding, trouble swallowing, cough, or problems caused by spread to other organs such as the brain

Section: Radiation Therapy for Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer > Types of radiation therapy used for NSCLC

Different types of radiation therapy can be used to treat NSCLC. There are 3 main types:
- External beam radiation therapy
- Brachytherapy (internal radiation therapy)
- Proton therapy

Section: Radiation Therapy for Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer > Types of radiation therapy used for NSCLC > External beam radiation therapy

---START CHUNK 56---
External beam radiation therapy (EBRT) focuses radiation from outside the body onto the cancer. This is the type of radiation therapy most often used to treat NSCLC or its spread to other organs.
Treatment is much like getting an x-ray, but the radiation dose is stronger. The procedure itself is painless, and each treatment lasts only a few minutes. Most often, radiation treatments to the lungs are given 5 days a week for 5 to 7 weeks, but this can vary based on the type of EBRT and the reason it’s being given.
Newer EBRT techniques have been shown to help doctors treat lung cancers more accurately while lowering the radiation exposure to nearby healthy tissues. These include:

---START CHUNK 57---
Newer EBRT techniques have been shown to help doctors treat lung cancers more accurately while lowering the radiation exposure to nearby healthy tissues. These include:
- Stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT), also known as stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR), is most often used to treat early-stage lung cancers when surgery isn’t an option due to a person’s health or in people who don’t want surgery. It might also be considered for tumors that have limited spread to other parts of the body, such as the brain or adrenal gland.
Instead of giving a small dose of radiation each day for several weeks, SBRT uses very focused beams of high-dose radiation given in fewer (usually 1 to 5) treatments. Several beams are aimed at the tumor from different angles. To target the radiation precisely, you are put in a specially designed body frame for each treatment. This reduces the movement of the lung tumor during breathing.

---START CHUNK 58---
- Three-dimensional conformal radiation therapy (3D-CRT) uses special computers to precisely map the tumor’s location. Radiation beams are then shaped and aimed at the tumor(s) from several directions, which makes it less likely to damage normal tissues. Intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) is a form of 3D therapy. Along with shaping the beams and aiming them at the tumor from several angles, the strength of the beams can be adjusted to limit the dose reaching nearby normal tissues. This technique is used most often if tumors are near important structures such as the spinal cord.
A variation of IMRT is called volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT). It uses a machine that delivers radiation quickly as it rotates once around the body. This allows each treatment to be given over just a few minutes.

---START CHUNK 59---
- Four-dimensional conformal radiation therapy (4DCT) shows where the tumor is in relation to other structures during each part of the breathing cycle, as opposed to just giving a “snapshot” of a point in time, like a standard CT does. This technique might also be used to help show if a tumor is attached to or invading important structures in the chest, which could help doctors determine if a patient might be eligible for surgery.

---START CHUNK 60---
- Stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) isn't really surgery, but a type of stereotactic radiation therapy that is given in only one session. It can sometimes be used instead of or along with surgery for single tumors that have spread to the brain. In one version of this treatment, a machine focuses about 200 beams of radiation on the tumor from different angles over a few minutes to hours. Your head is kept in the same position with a rigid frame. In another version, a linear accelerator (a machine that creates radiation) that is controlled by a computer moves around your head to deliver radiation to the tumor from many different angles. These treatments can be repeated if needed.
For more detailed descriptions of these procedures, see External Beam Radiation Therapy.

Section: Radiation Therapy for Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer > Types of radiation therapy used for NSCLC > Brachytherapy (internal radiation therapy)

In people with NSCLC, brachytherapy is sometimes used to shrink tumors in the airway to relieve symptoms.
The doctor places a small source of radioactive material (often in the form of small pellets) directly into the cancer or into the airway next to the cancer. This is usually done through a bronchoscope, but it may also be done during surgery. The radiation travels only a short distance from the source, limiting the effects on surrounding healthy tissues. The radiation source is usually removed after a short time. Less often, small radioactive “seeds” are left in place permanently, and the radiation gets weaker over several weeks.

Section: Radiation Therapy for Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer > Types of radiation therapy used for NSCLC > Proton therapy

In people with NSCLC, especially Stage III, proton therapy may be an option.  Proton therapy is a type of radiation that uses protons rather than x-rays. A proton is a positively charged particle, which can be targeted specifically to the tumor.  Compared to x-rays, proton therapy beams are less likely to damage surrounding organs, such as the heart and esophagus (tube we use to swallow). This form of radiation therapy continues to be studied, and is offered in most specialized lung cancer treatment centers.

Section: Radiation Therapy for Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer > Possible side effects of radiation therapy for NSCLC

---START CHUNK 64---
If you are going to get radiation therapy, it’s important to ask your doctor about the possible side effects so you know what to expect. Common side effects depend on where the radiation is aimed and can include:
- Fatigue
- Nausea and vomiting
- Loss of appetite and weight loss
- Skin changes in the area being treated, which can range from mild redness to blistering and peeling
- Hair loss where the radiation enters the body
Often these go away after treatment. When radiation is given with chemotherapy, the side effects may be worse.
Radiation therapy to the chest may damage your lungs and cause a cough, problems breathing, and shortness of breath. These usually improve after treatment is over, although sometimes they may not go away completely.

---START CHUNK 65---
Your esophagus, which is in the middle of your chest, may be exposed to radiation, which could cause a sore throat and trouble swallowing during treatment. This might make it hard to eat anything other than soft foods or liquids for a while. This also often improves after treatment is finished.
Radiation therapy to large areas of the brain can sometimes cause memory loss, headaches, or trouble thinking. Usually these symptoms are minor compared with those caused by cancer that has spread to the brain, but they can affect your quality of life.

Section: Can Lung Cancer Be Prevented? > Stay away from tobacco

The best way to reduce your risk of lung cancer is not to smoke and to avoid breathing in other people’s smoke.
If you stop smoking before a cancer develops, your damaged lung tissue gradually starts to repair itself. No matter what your age or how long you’ve smoked, quitting will lower your risk of lung cancer and help you live longer. If you would like help quitting smoking, see How to Quit Using Tobacco or call the American Cancer Society at 1-800-227-2345.

---START CHUNK 81---
A healthy diet with lots of fruits and vegetables may also help reduce your risk of lung cancer. Some evidence suggests that a diet high in fruits and vegetables may help protect people who smoke and those who don’t against lung cancer. But any positive effect of fruits and vegetables on lung cancer risk would be much less than the increased risk from smoking.
Trying to reduce the risk of lung cancer in people who currently smoke or those who formerly smoked by giving them high doses of vitamins or vitamin-like drugs has not been successful so far. In fact, some studies have found that supplements of beta-carotene, a nutrient related to vitamin A, appear to increase the rate of lung cancer in these people.
Some people who get lung cancer do not have any clear risk factors. Although we know how to prevent most lung cancers, at this time we don’t know how to prevent all of them.

Section: Immunotherapy for Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer > Immune checkpoint inhibitors

An important part of the immune system is its ability to keep itself from attacking normal cells in the body. To do this, it uses “checkpoint” proteins on immune cells, which act like switches that need to be turned on (or off) to start an immune response. Cancer cells sometimes use these checkpoints to avoid being attacked by the immune system.
Drugs that target these checkpoints (called checkpoint inhibitors) can be used to treat some people with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).

Nivolumab (Opdivo), Pembrolizumab (Keytruda), and Cemiplimab (Libtayo) target PD-1, a protein on certain immune cells (called T cells) that normally helps keep these cells from attacking other cells in the body. By blocking PD-1, these drugs boost the immune response against cancer cells. This can shrink some tumors or slow their growth.
Atezolizumab (Tecentriq) and Durvalumab (Imfinzi) target PD-L1, a protein related to PD-1 that is found on some tumor cells and immune cells. Blocking this protein can help boost the immune response against cancer cells. This can shrink some tumors or slow their growth.

---START CHUNK 99---
These drugs can be used in different situations to treat NSCLC. In some cases, before one of these drugs can be used, lab tests might need to be done on the cancer cells to show they have at least a certain amount of the PD-L1 protein (which would mean these drugs are more likely to work) and if the cancer cells have “driver mutations.” Depending on the results of those lab tests and the stage of lung cancer, the PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors can be used in different ways. They can be given with or without chemotherapy, with or without a CTLA-4 inhibitor (see below), before or after surgery for early-stage lung cancer, or for a long period of time for advanced-stage lung cancers.
All of these drugs are given as intravenous (IV) infusions. Depending on the drug, they might be given every 2, 3, 4, or 6 weeks. Atezolizumab can also be given (as Tecentriq Hybreza) as an injection under the skin (subcutaneously) over several minutes, typically once every 3 weeks.

---START CHUNK 101---
Side effects of these drugs can include fatigue, cough, nausea, itching, skin rash, loss of appetite, constipation, joint pain, and diarrhea.
Other, more serious side effects occur less often.
Infusion reactions: Some people might have an infusion reaction while getting these drugs. This is like an allergic reaction, and can include fever, chills, flushing of the face, rash, itchy skin, feeling dizzy, wheezing, and trouble breathing. It’s important to tell your cancer care team right away if you have any of these symptoms while getting these drugs.
Autoimmune reactions: These drugs work by removing one of the safeguards on the body’s immune system. Sometimes the immune system starts attacking other parts of the body, which can cause serious or even life-threatening problems in the lungs, intestines, liver, hormone-making glands, kidneys, or other organs.

---START CHUNK 102---
It’s very important to report any new side effects to your cancer care team as soon as possible. If serious side effects do occur, treatment may need to be stopped and you may get high doses of corticosteroids to suppress your immune system.

Ipilimumab (Yervoy) and tremelimumab (Imjudo) are also drugs that boost the immune response, but they block CTLA-4, another protein on T cells that normally helps keep them in check.
These drugs are used along with a PD-1 inhibitor (ipilimumab with nivolumab, and tremelimumab with durvalumab); they are not used alone. They might be an option as part of the first treatment for certain types of advanced NSCLC, most often along with chemo as well.
These drugs are given by intravenous (IV) infusion, usually once every 3 or 6 weeks.

The most common side effects of these drugs include fatigue, diarrhea, skin rash, itching, muscle or bone pain, and belly pain.
Serious side effects seem to happen more often with CTLA-4 inhibitors than with the PD-1 and PD-L1 inhibitors.
Infusion reactions: Some people might have an infusion reaction while getting one of these drugs. This is like an allergic reaction, and can include fever, chills, flushing of the face, rash, itchy skin, feeling dizzy, wheezing, and trouble breathing. It’s important to tell your doctor or nurse right away if you have any of these symptoms while getting an infusion.
It’s very important to report any new side effects during or after treatment with any of these drugs to your cancer care team promptly. If serious side effects do occur, you may need to stop treatment and take high doses of corticosteroids to suppress your immune system.

---START CHUNK 106---
Autoimmune reactions: These drugs can sometimes cause the immune system to attack other parts of the body, which can lead to serious problems in the intestines, liver, hormone-making glands, nerves, skin, eyes, or other organs. In some people, these side effects can be life-threatening.

Atezolizumab (Tecentriq) and durvalumab (Imfinzi) target PD-L1, a checkpoint protein found on some tumor cells and immune cells. Blocking this protein can help boost the immune response against cancer cells.
These drugs can be used as part of the first treatment for advanced SCLC, along with etoposide and a platinum chemo drug (like carboplatin or cisplatin). Either drug can then be continued alone as maintenance therapy after the chemo is done.
Durvalumab can be given for treatment of early stage SCLC, after chemo (ie. cisplatin and etoposide) with radiation has been given.
These drugs are given as an intravenous (IV) infusion, typically every 2, 3, or 4 weeks. Atezolizumab can also be given (as Tecentriq Hybreza) as an injection under the skin (subcutaneously) over several minutes, typically once every 3 weeks.

Section: Immunotherapy for Small Cell Lung Cancer > Bispecific T-cell engager (BiTE)

Tarlatamab (Imdelltra) is a type of immunotherapy know as a bispecific T-cell engager (BiTE). Once it’s injected into the body, one part of the drug attaches to immune cells called T cells, while another part attaches to the DLL3 protein on SCLC cells. This brings the two together, which helps the immune system attack the cancer cells.
Tarlatamab can be used to treat advanced (extensive-stage) SCLC that is no longer being helped by chemo that included a platinum drug (such as cisplatin or carboplatin).
This drug is given as an IV infusion, typically once a week at first, and then once every 2 weeks. Because of the risk of serious side effects such as cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and nervous system problems (see below), your doctor will want to watch you closely in a healthcare setting for about 24 hours after the first 2 infusions, and for at least several hours after later treatments.

---START CHUNK 129---
Common side effects of tarlatamab include:
- Fever
- Feeling very tired
- Nausea
- Loss of appetite
- A bad or metallic taste in your mouth
- Muscle or bone pain
- Constipation
- Abnormal blood test results
Tarlatamab can also cause more serious side effects:
Cytokine release syndrome (CRS): This is a serious side effect that can occur when T cells in the body release chemicals (cytokines) that ramp up the immune system. This happens most often within the first day after the infusion, and it can be life-threatening. Symptoms can include:
- F﻿ever and chills
- Severe nausea and vomiting
- Trouble breathing
- Feeling very tired
- Fast heartbeat
- Feeling dizzy, lightheaded, or confused
- Headache
- Problems with balance and movement, such as trouble walking
Your health care team will watch you closely for possible signs of CRS, especially during and after the first few infusions. Be sure to contact your health care team right away if you have any symptoms that might be from CRS.

---START CHUNK 130---
Nervous system problems: This drug can affect the nervous system, which could lead to serious or even life-threatening side effects that can occur days to weeks after treatment. Symptoms can include:
- Headaches
- Weakness, numbness, or tingling in the hands or feet
- Feeling dizzy or confused
- Trouble speaking or understanding things
- Memory loss
- Trouble sleeping
- Fainting
- Tremors
- Seizures
Serious infections: Some people might get a serious infection while getting this drug. Tell your cancer care team right away if you have a fever, cough, chest pain, shortness of breath, sore throat, rash, or pain when urinating.
Low blood cell counts: This drug might lower your blood cell counts, which can increase your risk of infections or bleeding and may make you feel tired or short of breath. Your doctor will check your blood cell counts regularly during your treatment.

---START CHUNK 131---
Liver problems: This drug can affect your liver, which might show up on lab tests. It might also cause symptoms such as feeling tired, loss of appetite, pain in the upper right part of your belly, dark colored urine, or yellowing of your skin or the white parts of your eyes (jaundice).

Chemotherapy (chemo) is treatment with anticancer drugs that may be injected into a vein or taken by mouth. These drugs travel through the bloodstream and reach most parts of the body.

Section: Chemotherapy for Small Cell Lung Cancer > When is chemotherapy used?

Chemo travels through the bloodstream and reach most parts of the body. It is typically part of the treatment for small cell lung cancer (SCLC). This is because SCLC has usually already spread by the time it is found , so treatments such as surgery alone or radiation therapy alone would not reach all areas of cancer.
- For people with limited-stage SCLC, chemo is often given with radiation therapy. This is known as chemoradiation.
- For people with extensive-stage SCLC, chemo with or without immunotherapy is usually the main treatment. Sometimes radiation therapy is given as well.
Some patients in poor health might not be able to tolerate intense doses of chemo or a combination of drugs. But older age by itself is not a reason to avoid chemo.

Section: Chemotherapy for Small Cell Lung Cancer > Chemo drugs used to treat SCLC

Generally, SCLC is first treated with combinations of chemo drugs. The combinations used most often are:
- Cisplatin and etoposide
- Carboplatin and etoposide
If the SCLC worsens or comes back after treatment with the above combination of chemo drugs, other chemo drugs may then be given. These drugs are usually given by themselves:
- Topotecan (Hycamtin)
- Lurbinectedin (Zepzelca)
- Docetaxel (Taxotere)
- Paclitaxel (Taxol)
- Gemcitabine (Gemzar)
- Irinotecan (Camptosar)
- Temozolomide (Temodar)
- Vinorelbine (Navelbine)

Section: Chemotherapy for Small Cell Lung Cancer > How is chemotherapy given?

---START CHUNK 149---
Chemo drugs for lung cancer are typically given into a vein (intravenous [IV]), either as an injection over a few minutes or as an infusion over a longer period of time. This can be done in a doctor’s office, chemotherapy clinic, or in a hospital.
Often, slightly larger and sturdier IVs known as central venous catheters (CVCs), central venous access devices (CVADs), or central lines are needed to give chemo. They are used to put medicines, blood products, nutrients, or fluids right into your blood. They can also be used to take out blood for testing.

---START CHUNK 150---
Many different kinds of CVCs are available. The 2 most common types are the port and the PICC (peripherally inserted central catheter) line. A port is a small quarter-sized device that is placed under the skin in your upper chest. A small tube connects the port to a large vein that goes into the heart, called the superior vena cava. A PICC line is a small tube that is placed in the upper arm; that tube threads through the vein until it reaches the superior vena cava.
Doctors give chemo in cycles. Each cycle includes the period of treatment followed by a rest period to give you time to recover from the effects of the drugs. Cycles are most often 3 or 4 weeks long, and initial treatment is typically 4 to 6 cycles. The schedule varies depending on the drugs used. For example, some drugs are given only on the first day of the chemo cycle. Others are given for a few days in a row, or once a week. Then, at the end of the cycle, the chemo schedule repeats to start the next cycle.

---START CHUNK 151---
For advanced cancers, the initial chemo combination is often given for 4 to 6 cycles, sometimes in combination with an immunotherapy drug. Beyond this, doctors might also recommend extending treatment with a single immunotherapy drug, for people who have had a good response to their initial chemotherapy or have had no worsening of their cancer.
If the cancer progresses (gets worse) during treatment or returns after treatment is finished, other chemo drugs may be tried. The choice of drugs depends to some extent on how soon the cancer begins to grow again. (The longer it takes for the cancer to return, the more likely it is to respond to further treatment.)
- If cancer returns more than 6 months after treatment, it might respond again to the same chemo drugs that were given the first time.

---START CHUNK 152---
- If cancer returns more than 6 months after treatment, it might respond again to the same chemo drugs that were given the first time.
- If the cancer comes back sooner, or if it keeps growing during treatment, further treatment with the same drugs isn’t likely to be helpful. If further chemo is given, most doctors prefer treatment with a single, different drug to help limit side effects. SCLC that progresses or comes back can be hard to treat, so taking part in a clinical trial of newer treatments might be a good option for some people.

Section: Chemotherapy for Small Cell Lung Cancer > Possible side effects of chemotherapy for SCLC

---START CHUNK 154---
Chemo drugs can cause side effects. These depend on the type and dose of drugs given and how long they are taken. Some common side effects of chemo include:
- Hair loss
- Mouth sores
- Loss of appetite or weight changes
- Nausea and vomiting
- Diarrhea or constipation
Chemo can also affect the blood-forming cells of the bone marrow, which can lead to:
- Increased chance of infections (from low white blood cell counts)
- Easy bruising or bleeding (from low blood platelet counts)
- Fatigue ((tiredness, from low red blood cell counts)
These side effects usually go away after treatment, but there are also often ways to lessen them. For example:
- Drugs can be given to help prevent or reduce nausea and vomiting.
- Drugs can be used to help prevent or treat low blood cell counts (especially low white blood cell counts)..
Some drugs can have specific side effects. For example:

---START CHUNK 155---
- Drugs can be used to help prevent or treat low blood cell counts (especially low white blood cell counts)..
Some drugs can have specific side effects. For example:
- Drugs such as cisplatin and carboplatin can damage nerve endings. This is called peripheral neuropathy. It can sometimes lead to symptoms (mainly in the hands and feet), such as numbness or tingling sensations, burning or pain, sensitivity to cold or heat, or muscle weakness. In most people, this goes away or gets better after treatment is stopped, but it may last a long time in some people.
- Cisplatin can also cause kidney damage. To help prevent this, doctors give lots of IV fluids before and after each dose of the drug is given.
Be sure to report any side effects you notice during chemo to your cancer care team so that they can be treated promptly. In some cases, the doses of the chemo drugs may need to be reduced or treatment may need to be delayed or stopped to prevent the effects from getting worse.

As researchers have learned more about the changes in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells that help them grow, they have developed drugs to specifically target these changes.

Section: Targeted Drug Therapy for Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer > When is targeted therapy used?

Targeted drugs work differently from standard chemotherapy (chemo) drugs. They sometimes work when chemo drugs don’t, and they often have different side effects. At this time, targeted drugs are most often used for advanced lung cancers, either along with chemo or by themselves.

Section: Targeted Drug Therapy for Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer > Angiogenesis inhibitors

---START CHUNK 171---
How they work (mechanism of action): For tumors to grow, they need to form new blood vessels to keep them nourished. This process is called angiogenesis. Angiogenesis inhibitors help stop the formation of new blood vessels. These inhibitors are generally monoclonal antibodies (lab-made versions of a specific immune system protein) that target vascular the endothelial growth factor (VEGF), a protein that helps new blood vessels to form, called VEGF inhibitors.
Examples of VEGF inhibitors:
- Bevacizumab (Avastin) is used in combination with chemotherapy, immunotherapy, or the targeted drug erlotinib for management of advanced or metastatic NSCLC.
- Ramucirumab (Cyramza) is used in combination with the targeted drug erlotinib or chemotherapy for management of advanced or metastatic NSCLC.
Side effects of angiogenesis inhibitors:
- Common side effects: Nosebleed, headache, high blood pressure, protein in urine, change in taste, dry skin, back pain, dry skin, excessive tearing

---START CHUNK 172---
Side effects of angiogenesis inhibitors:
- Common side effects: Nosebleed, headache, high blood pressure, protein in urine, change in taste, dry skin, back pain, dry skin, excessive tearing
- Rare, but serious side effects: Severe bleeding, formation of holes (perforations) in the intestine, issues with wound healing, clots in the heart and/or brain, and brain damage called reversible posterior leukoencephalopathy syndrome. (RPLS), very high blood pressure, kidney damage, allergic reaction to the drug (infusion reaction), thyroid damage, ovarian failure, and fetal harm.
Because of the risks of bleeding, these drugs often aren’t used in people who are coughing up blood or who are taking drugs called blood thinners. The risk of serious bleeding in the lungs is higher in patients with the squamous cell type of NSCLC, which is why current guidelines do not recommend using bevacizumab in people with this type of lung cancer.

Section: Targeted Drug Therapy for Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer > KRAS inhibitors

---START CHUNK 174---
How they work (mechanism of action): In some NSCLCs, the cancer cells have changes in the KRAS gene that cause them to make an abnormal form of the KRAS protein. This abnormal protein helps the cancer cells grow and spread. About 1 in 8 people with NSCLC have a specific type of KRAS gene change called a KRAS G12C mutation. KRAS inhibitors attach to the KRAS G12C protein, which helps keep cancer cells from growing.
These drugs are taken as pills, typically once or twice a day.
NSCLCs with this mutation are often resistant to other targeted drugs, such as EGFR inhibitors (see below).
Examples of KRAS inhibitors:
- Sotorasib (Lumakras) is used alone for advanced NSCLC with the KRAS G12C mutation if you’ve already had at least one other type of drug treatment.
- Adagrasib (Krazati) can be used in ways similar to sotorasib.
Side effects of KRAS inhibitors:

---START CHUNK 175---
- Adagrasib (Krazati) can be used in ways similar to sotorasib.
Side effects of KRAS inhibitors:
- Common side effects: Diarrhea, nausea and vomiting, muscle pain, fatigue, cough, decreased white blood cell and red blood cell counts, and changes in other blood tests.
- Rare, but serious side effects: Kidney damage, liver damage, lung damage called interstitial lung disease (ILD)/ pneumonitis, and a heart condition called QTc interval prolongation (see below).

Section: Targeted Drug Therapy for Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer > EGFR inhibitors

---START CHUNK 177---
How they work (mechanism of action): Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is a protein on the surface of cells. It normally helps the cells grow and divide. Sometimes NSCLC cells have too much EGFR, which makes them grow faster. Drugs called EGFR inhibitors can block the signal from EGFR that tells the cancer cells to grow. These drugs are often used to treat advanced NSCLCs that have certain mutations in the EGFR gene, although osimertinib can also be used as an adjuvant (additional) treatment after surgery for some earlier-stage lung cancers.
Examples of EGFR inhibitors:
EGFR inhibitors that target cells with either an exon 19 or exon 21 mutation:
- Drugs such afatinib (Gilotrif), erlotinib (Tarceva), dacomitinib (Vizimpro), gefitinib (Iressa), and osimertinib (Tagresso) can be given alone.
- Lazertinib (Lazcluze) in combination with amivantamab (Rybrevant).
- Osimertinib in combination with chemotherapy (cisplatin or carboplatin with pemetrexed).

---START CHUNK 178---
- Lazertinib (Lazcluze) in combination with amivantamab (Rybrevant).
- Osimertinib in combination with chemotherapy (cisplatin or carboplatin with pemetrexed).
- Erlotinib in combination with a VEGF inhibitor (ramucirumab or bevacizumab).
- Amivantamab in combination with chemo (carboplatin and pemetrexed).
EGFR inhibitors that target cells with S768I, L861Q and/or G719X mutations:
- Drugs such as afatinib (Gilotrif), osimertinib (Tagrisso), erlotinib (Tarceva), dacomitinib (Vizimpro), and gefitinib (Iressa) can be given alone.
- Amivantamab in combination with chemo (carboplatin and pemetrexed).
EGFR inhibitors that target cells with an exon 20 mutation:
- Amivantamab (Rybrevant) in combination with chemo (carboplatin and pemetrexed). Amivantamab is a monoclonal antibody (a lab-made version of a specific immune system protein) that targets two proteins that help cancer cells grow: EGFR and MET. Because it binds to two proteins, it’s called a bispecific antibody.

---START CHUNK 179---
- Amivantamab given alone is also an option after chemotherapy has been tried.
Side effects of EGFR inhibitors:
- Common side effects: Skin problems, nail changes, fatigue, loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea.
- Rare, but serious side effects: A lung condition called interstitial lung disease (ILD)/ pneumonitis; damage to the heart muscle; heart rhythm changes; other organ damage including kidney, gut and liver; harm to a fetus; and severe skin rashes.

Section: Targeted Drug Therapy for Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer > ALK inhibitors

---START CHUNK 181---
How they work (mechanism of action): About 5% of NSCLCs have a rearrangement in a gene called ALK. This change is often seen in people who don’t smoke (or who are light smokers), who are younger, and who have the adenocarcinoma subtype of NSCLC. The ALK gene rearrangement produces an abnormal ALK protein that causes the cells to grow and spread. Drugs that inhibit this ALK protein are called ALK inhibitors and are taken as an oral pill.
Examples of ALK inhibitors:
- Third-generation ALK inhibitor [Lorlatinib (Lorbrena)] and second-generation ALK inhibitors [alectinib (Alecensa), brigatinib (Alunbrig), ceritinib (Zykadia), and ensartinib (Ensacove)] are often the preferred first treatment for advanced NSCLC with the ALK rearrangement mutation. These later generation ALK inhibitors tend to get into the brain better than crizotinib, a first-generation ALK inhibitor.

---START CHUNK 182---
- Alectinib (Alecensa) can be given to patients with early stage ALK-positive NSCLC in the adjuvant setting (after the lung tumor has been removed).
- First- generation ALK inhibitor: Crizotinib (Xalkori) was the first ALK inhibitor approved for advanced NSCLC with an ALK rearrangement. It is still given in certain situations.
Side effects of ALK inhibitors:
- Common side effects: Vision changes, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, swelling in hands and/or feet, tiredness, muscle soreness, rash, cough, nerve damage (peripheral neuropathy), and changes in lab values.
- Rare, but serious side effects: Liver damage; a lung condition called interstitial lung disease (ILD)/pneumonitis; changes in heart rhythm; and harm to a fetus.

Section: Targeted Drug Therapy for Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer > ROS1 inhibitors

---START CHUNK 184---
How they work (mechanism of action): About 1% to 2% of NSCLCs have a rearrangement in a gene called ROS1. This change is most often seen in people who have the adenocarcinoma subtype of NSCLC and whose tumors are also negative for ALK, KRAS and EGFR mutations. The ROS1 gene rearrangement is similar to the ALK gene rearrangement, and some drugs can work on cells with either ALK or ROS1 gene changes. These drugs, called ROS1 inhibitors, can often shrink tumors in people whose advanced lung cancers have a ROS1 gene change. They are taken as a pill.
Examples of ROS1 inhibitors:
- Entrectinib (Rozlytrek), crizotinib (Xalkori),and ceritinib (Zykadia) are often the first treatment options for advanced NSCLC with a ROS1 rearrangement.
- Lorlatinib (Lorbrena) is an option for patients with ROS1-mutated advanced NSCLC who have already been treated with the either entrectinib, crizotinib, or ceritinib.

---START CHUNK 185---
- Lorlatinib (Lorbrena) is an option for patients with ROS1-mutated advanced NSCLC who have already been treated with the either entrectinib, crizotinib, or ceritinib.
- Repotrectinib (Augtyro) is an option for patients with ROS1-mutated advanced NSCLC who have or who have not been treated with a ROS1 inhibitor.
Side effects of ROS1 inhibitors:
- Common side effects: Vision changes, muscle soreness, swelling in hands and/or feet, nerve damage (called peripheral neuropathy), diarrhea, fatigue, and changes in lab tests.
- Rare, but serious side effects: Liver damage; changes in heart rhythm and heart function; lung condition called interstitial lung disease (ILD)/pneumonitis; high blood pressure; changes in mood or mental status; and harm to a fetus.

Section: Targeted Drug Therapy for Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer > BRAF inhibitors

---START CHUNK 187---
How they work (mechanism of action): In some NSCLCs, the cells have changes in the BRAF gene. Cells with these changes make an altered BRAF protein that helps them grow. Some drugs target this and related proteins.
These drugs are taken as pills or capsules each day.
Examples of BRAF inhibitors:
- Combination treatment: A combination of BRAF inhibitor and a MEK inhibitor is often given together as the first or later treatment for advanced NSCLC with the BRAF V600E mutation. Examples include:
- Dabrafenib (Tafinlar), a BRAF inhibitor, with trametinib (Mekinist), a MEK inhibitor
- Encorafenib (Braftovi), a BRAF inhibitor, with binimetinib (Mektovi), a MEK inhibitor
- Single drug treatment: Vemurafenib (Zelboraf), another BRAF inhibitor, or dabrafenib can be taken alone if the patient can’t take the combination treatment.
Side effects of BRAF inhibitors:

---START CHUNK 188---
- Single drug treatment: Vemurafenib (Zelboraf), another BRAF inhibitor, or dabrafenib can be taken alone if the patient can’t take the combination treatment.
Side effects of BRAF inhibitors:
- Common side effects: Skin thickening, rash, itching, sensitivity to the sun, headache, fever, joint pain, tiredness, hair loss, nausea, and diarrhea.
- Rare, but serious side effects: Bleeding, heart rhythm problems, liver or kidney problems, lung problems, severe allergic reactions, severe skin or eye problems, increased blood sugar levels, and squamous cell skin cancer.

Section: Targeted Drug Therapy for Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer > RET inhibitors

---START CHUNK 190---
How they work (mechanism of action): In a small percentage of NSCLCs, the tumor cells have rearrangement in the RET gene that cause them to make an abnormal form of the RET protein. This abnormal protein helps the tumor cells grow. Drugs known as RET inhibitors can be used to treat advanced NSCLC with the RET rearrangement.
These drugs are taken by mouth as capsules, typically once or twice a day.
Examples of RET inhibitors:
- Selpercatinib (Retevmo) or pralsetinib (Gayreto) is often the preferred first treatment for metastatic NSCLC with the RET rearrangement.
- Cabozantinib (Cometriq, Cabometyx) has activity against RET, ROS1, MET, and VEGF. It can be used to treat RET-mutated NSCLC in certain situations.
Side effects of RET inhibitors:
- Common side effects: Dry mouth, diarrhea or constipation, high blood pressure, tiredness, swelling in hands and/or feet, skin rash, muscle and joint pain, and low blood cell counts or changes in other blood tests.

Section: Targeted Drug Therapy for Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer > MET inhibitors

---START CHUNK 193---
How they work (mechanism of action): In some NSCLCs, cancer cells have changes in the MET gene, called a MET exon 14 skipping mutation, that cause them to make an abnormal form of the MET protein. This abnormal protein helps the cancer cells grow and spread. Drugs called MET inhibitors can be used to treat metastatic NSCLC if the cancer cells have certain types of MET gene changes, by attacking the MET protein. They are taken as a pill once or twice a day.
Examples of MET inhibitors:
- Capmatinib (Tabrecta) or tepotinib (Tepmetko) is often the preferred first treatment for metastatic NSCLC with the MET exon 14 skipping mutation.
- Crizotinib (Xalkori) has activity against MET, ALK, and ROS1. It can be used to treat MET-mutated NSCLC in certain situations.
Side effects of MET inhibitors:
- Common side effects: Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, tiredness, swelling in hands and/or feet, muscle and joint pain, low blood cell counts, or changes in other blood tests.

---START CHUNK 194---
- Common side effects: Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, tiredness, swelling in hands and/or feet, muscle and joint pain, low blood cell counts, or changes in other blood tests.
- Rare, but serious side effects: A lung condition called interstitial lung disease (ILD)/pneumonitis; liver damage; harm to a fetus; and increased sensitivity to sunlight (photosensitivity).

Section: Targeted Drug Therapy for Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer > HER2-directed drugs

---START CHUNK 196---
How they work (mechanism of action): In a small percentage of NSCLCs, the cancer cells have certain changes in the HER2 (ERBB2) gene that help them grow. HER2-directed drugs can be used to treat metastatic NSCLC if the cancer cells have certain types of HER2 gene changes. These drugs are infused into a vein (IV). They are typically given once every few weeks.
Examples of HER2 inhibitors:
- Fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan-nxki (Enhertu) is an antibody-drug conjugate (ADC). It’s made up of a lab-made antibody that targets the HER2 protein, which is linked to a chemotherapy drug. The antibody acts like a homing signal by attaching to the HER2 protein on cancer cells, bringing the chemo directly to them. It can be used to treat NSCLC with HER2 mutations if you’ve already had at least one other type of drug treatment.
- Ado-trastuzumab emtansine (Kadcyla) is also a HER2-targeted ADC. It can be used to treat HER2-mutated NSCLC in certain situations.

---START CHUNK 197---
- Ado-trastuzumab emtansine (Kadcyla) is also a HER2-targeted ADC. It can be used to treat HER2-mutated NSCLC in certain situations.
- Zenocutuzumab-zbco (Bizengri) is a bispecific antibody that binds to HER2 and HER3 and prevents a protein called neuregulin 1 (NRG1) from binding to HER3. It can be used to treat NSCLC with a NRG1 gene fusion mutation, if you've already had at least one other type of drug treatment.
Side effects of HER2 inhibitors:
- Common side effects: Low white blood cell, red blood cell, and platelet counts; tiredness; hair loss; nausea and vomiting; muscle and joint pain; and changes in other blood tests.
- Rare, but serious side effects, specific to fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan: Changes in heart function and a severely low white blood cell count, which increases your risk of infection.

Section: Targeted Drug Therapy for Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer > TRK inhibitors

---START CHUNK 199---
How they work (mechanism of action): A very small number of NSCLCs have changes in one of the NTRK genes, called NTRK gene fusions. Cells with these gene changes make abnormal TRK proteins, which can lead to abnormal cell growth and cancer. TRK inhibitors target and disable the proteins made by the NTRK genes.
These drugs are taken as pills, once or twice daily.
Examples of TRK inhibitors:
- Larotrectinib (Vitrakyi) or entrectinib (Rozlytrek) is often the preferred first treatment for metastatic NSCLC with an NTRK gene fusion mutation.
Side effects of NTRK inhibitors:
- Common side effects: Abnormal liver tests; decreased white blood cell and red blood cells; muscle and joint pain; tiredness; diarrhea or constipation; nausea and vomiting; and stomach pain.
- Rare, but serious side effects: Mental changes, such as confusion, changes in mood, changes in sleep; liver damage; changes in heart rhythm and/or function; vision changes; and harm to a fetus.

We don’t know what causes each case of lung cancer. But we do know many of the risk factors for these cancers (see Lung Cancer Risk Factors) and how some of them cause normal cells to become cancer cells.

Section: What Causes Lung Cancer? > How smoking leads to lung cancer

Smoking tobacco is by far the leading cause of lung cancer. About 80% of lung cancer deaths are caused by smoking, and many others are caused by exposure to secondhand smoke.
Smoking is clearly the strongest risk factor for lung cancer, but it often interacts with other factors. People who smoke and are exposed to other known risk factors, such as radon and asbestos, are at an even higher risk. Not everyone who smokes gets lung cancer, so other factors like genetics probably play a role as well (see below).

Section: What Causes Lung Cancer? > Causes in people who don’t smoke

Not all people who get lung cancer smoke. Many people with lung cancer formerly smoked, but many others never smoked at all.
Lung cancer in people who don’t smoke can be caused by exposure to radon, secondhand smoke, air pollution, or other factors. Workplace exposures to asbestos, diesel exhaust, or other chemicals can also cause lung cancers in some people who don’t smoke.
Some people with no known risk factors may develop lung cancer. This may be due to random events that don’t have an outside cause, but it also may be due to factors that we don’t yet know about.
Lung cancers in people who don’t smoke are often different from those that occur in people who do. They tend to develop in younger people and often have certain gene changes that are different from those in tumors found in people who smoke. In some cases, these gene changes can be used to guide treatment.

Section: What Causes Lung Cancer? > Gene changes that may lead to lung cancer

DNA is the molecule in our cells that makes up our genes, which control how our cells function. DNA, which comes from both our parents, affects more than just how we look. It also can influence our risk for developing certain diseases, including some kinds of cancer.
Some genes help control when cells grow, divide to make new cells, and die:
- Genes that help cells grow, divide, or stay alive are called oncogenes.
- Genes that help control cell division or cause cells to die at the right time are called tumor suppressor genes.
Cancers can be caused by DNA changes that turn on oncogenes or turn off tumor suppressor genes. Changes in many different genes are usually needed to cause lung cancer. There are primarily two types of gene mutations (changes): germline mutations and somatic mutations.

Section: What Causes Lung Cancer? > Inherited gene changes (germline mutations)

---START CHUNK 217---
Inherited gene changes, or germline mutations, are gene changes that you inherit from your parents. These are the mutations in your DNA that you inherit from the egg and sperm cells when you are conceived.  Some people inherit DNA mutations  from their parents that may increase their risk for developing certain cancers.  Historically, germline mutations were not thought to cause very many lung cancers. However, recent studies have shown there may be a benefit to test all patients with lung cancer for germline mutations. If germline mutations are found, it would not only show that you were at an increased hereditary risk for developing lung cancer, but it could also help guide discussions about the best way to treat your lung cancer. If you have lung cancer and are also found to have a certain germline mutation, you may respond well to that mutation’s targeted therapy.

---START CHUNK 218---
Examples of possible germline mutations for patients with lung cancer include: CHEK2, ATM, TP53, BRCA1, EGFR, APC, and PALB2. Studies are ongoing to better understand the role of germline mutations in lung cancer. Regardless of whether you carry a higher hereditary risk for lung cancer, doctors recommend that all people avoid tobacco smoke and other exposures that will increase cancer risk.

Section: What Causes Lung Cancer? > Acquired gene changes (somatic mutations or “driver mutations”)

---START CHUNK 220---
Acquired gene changes, or somatic mutations, may occur in any individual cell and cannot be inherited. Somatic mutations refer to DNA changes within cells that were not passed from your parents, but rather were acquired during your lifetime. Certain somatic mutations can affect the cell’s ability to control its own growth, and will eventually transform a non-cancer cell to become a cancer cell. These somatic mutations are also known as “driver mutations.” If your tumor is found to have a driver mutation, you will likely respond well to targeted therapy.

---START CHUNK 221---
For patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer, it is recommended that the lung mass or a metastatic mass be tested for driver mutations. It is standard practice to test for the following driver mutations: EGFR, ALK, ROS1, MET, RET, BRAF, and NTRK. If any of these driver mutations are found, initial treatment with a targeted therapy (rather than chemotherapy) would be recommended. Although these mutations can be found in any patient with lung cancer, nonsmokers with lung cancer are more likely to have a driver mutation.

Section: Radiofrequency Ablation (RFA) for Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer

Many people with non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) are not healthy enough to undergo surgery. Some people might have a lung tumor in a place that makes surgery very difficult. Others might have advanced lung cancer and lung surgery may not be helpful. In these cases, ablative treatments (ablation) may be a treatment option. Ablative treatment is the use of temperature (hot and cold) to kill cancer cells and their surrounding tissue.

- Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) uses high-energy radio waves to heat and destroy the tumor cells.
- Cryoablation uses liquid nitrogen or argon gas to freeze and destroy the tumor cells.
- Microwave ablation uses electromagnetic energy to heat and destroy the tumor cells.

---START CHUNK 236---
- Ablation using percutaneous approach: A thin, needle-like probe is put through the skin and moved in until the tip is in the tumor. Placement of the probe is guided by CT scans. This is usually done as an outpatient procedure, using local anesthesia (numbing medicine) where the probe is inserted. You may be given medicine to help you relax.
- Ablation using bronchoscopy: You will be given anesthesia for the bronchoscopy. Ablation will be done through the bronchoscopy tube and your airway, rather than from the outside through the skin. This is still quite a new way to give ablative treatment.
Major complications are uncommon, but they can include the partial collapse of a lung (which often goes away on its own) or bleeding into the lung.

Section: Signs and Symptoms of Lung Cancer > Let your doctor know if you have symptoms

---START CHUNK 250---
If you go to your doctor when you first notice symptoms, your cancer might be diagnosed at an earlier stage, when treatment is more likely to be effective.
Most of these symptoms are more likely to be caused by something other than lung cancer. Still, if you have any of these problems, it’s important to see your doctor right away so the cause can be found and treated, if needed.
The most common symptoms of lung cancer are:
- A cough that does not go away or gets worse
- Coughing up blood or rust-colored sputum (spit or phlegm)
- Chest pain that is often worse with deep breathing, coughing, or laughing
- Hoarseness
- Loss of appetite
- Unexplained weight loss
- Shortness of breath
- Feeling tired or weak
- Infections such as bronchitis and pneumonia that don’t go away or keep coming back
- New onset of wheezing
If lung cancer spreads to other parts of the body, it may cause:
- Bone pain (like pain in the back or hips)

---START CHUNK 251---
- New onset of wheezing
If lung cancer spreads to other parts of the body, it may cause:
- Bone pain (like pain in the back or hips)
- Nervous system changes (such as headache, weakness or numbness of an arm or leg, dizziness, balance problems, or seizures), from cancer spread to the brain
- Yellowing of the skin and eyes (jaundice), from cancer spread to the liver
- Swelling of lymph nodes (collection of immune system cells) such as those in the neck or above the collarbone
Some lung cancers can cause syndromes, which are groups of specific symptoms.

Section: Signs and Symptoms of Lung Cancer > Let your doctor know if you have symptoms > Horner syndrome

Cancers of the upper part of the lungs are sometimes called Pancoast tumors. These tumors are more likely to be non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) than small cell lung cancer (SCLC).
Pancoast tumors can affect certain nerves to the eye and part of the face, causing a group of symptoms called Horner syndrome:
- Drooping or weakness of one upper eyelid
- A smaller pupil (dark part in the center of the eye) on the same side of the face
- Little or no sweating on the same side of the face
Pancoast tumors can also sometimes cause severe shoulder pain.

Section: Signs and Symptoms of Lung Cancer > Let your doctor know if you have symptoms > Superior vena cava syndrome

The superior vena cava (SVC) is a large vein that carries blood from the head and arms down to the heart. It passes next to the upper part of the right lung and the lymph nodes inside the chest. Tumors in this area can press on the SVC, which can cause the blood to back up in the veins. This can lead to swelling in the face, neck, arms, and upper chest (sometimes with a bluish-red skin color), as well as trouble breathing. It can also cause headaches, dizziness, and a change in consciousness if it affects the brain. While SVC syndrome can develop gradually over time, in some cases it can become life-threatening, and needs to be treated right away.

Section: Signs and Symptoms of Lung Cancer > Let your doctor know if you have symptoms > Paraneoplastic syndromes

---START CHUNK 255---
Some lung cancers may cause problems in distant tissues and organs, even though the cancer has not spread to those places. These problems are called paraneoplastic syndromes. Paraneoplastic syndromes can affect your nervous system (paraneoplastic neurologic syndrome) or your endocrine system (paraneoplastic endocrine syndrome).Sometimes these syndromes may be the first symptoms of lung cancer. Because the symptoms affect other organs, a disease other than lung cancer may first be suspected as causing them.
Paraneoplastic syndromes can happen with any lung cancer but are more often associated with small cell lung cancer (SCLC).
In paraneoplastic endocrine syndrome, the lung tumor makes hormone-like substances that enter the bloodstream and affect distant organs. Examples include:

---START CHUNK 256---
In paraneoplastic endocrine syndrome, the lung tumor makes hormone-like substances that enter the bloodstream and affect distant organs. Examples include:
- SIADH (syndrome of inappropriate anti-diuretic hormone): There are many diseases that can cause SIADH. Cancer is one of them. In this condition, the cancer cells make ADH (anti-diuretic hormone), a hormone that causes the kidneys to keep too much water in the body. This lowers salt levels in the blood. Symptoms of SIADH can include fatigue, loss of appetite, muscle weakness or cramps, nausea, vomiting, restlessness, and confusion. Without treatment, severe cases may lead to seizures and coma.

---START CHUNK 257---
- Cushing syndrome: There are many reasons why a person may develop Cushing syndrome. Cancer is one of them and is called ectopic Cushing syndrome. In this condition, the cancer cells make ACTH (adrenocorticotropic hormone), a hormone that causes the adrenal glands to make cortisol. This can lead to symptoms that include weight gain, easy bruising, weakness, drowsiness, and fluid retention. Cushing syndrome can also cause high blood pressure, high blood sugar levels, or even diabetes.
- Hypercalcemia: The tumor can make a hormone called parathyroid hormone-related peptide (PTHrP) that acts on the bones and kidney to increase the level of calcium in the blood. High levels of calcium in the blood (hypercalcemia can cause frequent urination, thirst, constipation, nausea, vomiting, belly pain, weakness, fatigue, dizziness, and confusion.

---START CHUNK 258---
In paraneoplastic neurologic syndrome, the tumor can cause the body’s immune system to mistakenly attack parts of the nervous system (brain, spinal cord, nerves), rather than the cancer cells. Examples include:
- Lambert-Eaton syndrome: In this syndrome, the tumor may cause the immune system to attack the neuromuscular junction, which is the place where nerves communicate with muscle. This can lead to muscle weakness and issues with walking, speaking, and swallowing.  One of the first signs may be trouble getting up from a sitting position. Later, muscles around the shoulder may become weak.

---START CHUNK 259---
- Paraneoplastic cerebellar degeneration: This disease can be caused by many different cancers, including small cell lung cancer. The immune system makes antibodies meant to attack the tumor, but instead mistakenly attacks an area of the brain called the cerebellum. This can lead to loss of balance and unsteadiness in arm and leg movement, trouble speaking, trouble swallowing, and changes in vision.
- Paraneoplastic limbic encephalitis: The limbic system is a part of the brain that is in charge of storing memory, and controlling emotions and behavior, as well as blood pressure and heart rate. The tumor may cause the immune system to damage the limbic system. This can lead to memory loss, personality changes, mood changes, sleep issues, and seizures.
Again, many of these symptoms are more likely to be caused by something other than lung cancer. Still, if you have any of these problems, it’s important to see your doctor right away so the cause can be found and treated, if needed.

Section: Lung Cancer Risk Factors > Factors that may affect lung cancer risk

Different cancers have different risk factors. Some risk factors, like smoking, can be changed. Others, like a person’s age or family history, can’t be changed.
But having a risk factor, or even several, does not mean that you will get the disease. And some people who get the disease may have few or no known risk factors.
Several risk factors can make you more likely to develop lung cancer. These factors are related to the risk of lung cancer in general.

Section: Lung Cancer Risk Factors > Risk factors you can change > Tobacco smoke

Smoking is by far the leading risk factor for lung cancer. About 80% of lung cancer deaths are thought to result from smoking, and this number is probably even higher for small cell lung cancer (SCLC). It’s rare for someone who has never smoked to have SCLC.
The risk of lung cancer for people who smoke is many times higher than for people who don’t smoke. The longer you smoke and the more packs a day you smoke, the greater your risk.
Cigar smoking, pipe smoking, and menthol cigarette smoking are almost as likely to cause lung cancer as cigarette smoking. Smoking low-tar or “light” cigarettes increases lung cancer risk as much as regular cigarettes.

Section: Lung Cancer Risk Factors > Risk factors you can change > Exposure to radon

Radon is a naturally occurring radioactive gas that results from the breakdown of uranium in soil and rocks. You can’t see, taste, or smell it. According to the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), radon is the second-leading cause of lung cancer in the United States, and it’s the leading cause among people who don’t smoke.
Outdoors, there is so little radon that it is not likely to be dangerous. But indoors, radon can be more concentrated. Breathing it in exposes your lungs to small amounts of radon. This may increase a person’s risk of lung cancer.
Homes and other buildings in nearly any part of the country can have high indoor radon levels (especially in basements).
For more information, see Radon and Cancer.

Section: Lung Cancer Risk Factors > Risk factors you can change > Exposure to asbestos

---START CHUNK 276---
People who work with asbestos (such as in mines, mills, textile plants, places where insulation is used, and shipyards) are several times more likely to die of lung cancer. Lung cancer risk is much greater in workers exposed to asbestos who also smoke. It’s not clear how much low-level or short-term exposure to asbestos might raise lung cancer risk.
People exposed to large amounts of asbestos also have a greater risk of developing mesothelioma, a type of cancer that starts in the pleura (the lining surrounding the lungs). For more on this type of cancer, see Mesothelioma.
In recent years, government regulations have greatly reduced the use of asbestos in commercial and industrial products. It’s still present in many homes and other older buildings, but it’s not usually considered harmful as long as it’s not released into the air by deterioration, demolition, or renovation. For more information, see Asbestos and Cancer Risk.

Other carcinogens (cancer-causing agents) found in some workplaces that can increase lung cancer risk include:
- Radioactive ores, such as uranium
- Inhaled chemicals, such as arsenic, beryllium, cadmium, silica, vinyl chloride, nickel compounds, chromium compounds, coal products, mustard gas, and chloromethyl ethers
- Diesel exhaust
The government and industry have taken steps in recent years to help protect workers from many of these exposures. But the dangers are still there, so if you work around these agents, be careful to limit your exposure whenever possible.

Studies looking at the possible role of vitamin supplements in reducing lung cancer risk have had disappointing results. In fact, multiple studies found that people who smoked and took beta-carotene supplements actually had an increased risk of lung cancer. The results of these studies suggest that people should avoid taking beta-carotene supplements.

In most of these studies, the levels of arsenic in the water were many times higher than those typically seen in the United States, even areas where arsenic levels are above normal. For most Americans who are on public water systems, drinking water is not a major source of arsenic.

Section: Lung Cancer Risk Factors > Risk factors you cannot change > Previous radiation therapy to the lungs

People who have had radiation therapy to the chest for other cancers are at higher risk for lung cancer, particularly if they smoke. Examples include people who have been treated for Hodgkin lymphoma  or women who were treated with chest radiation for breast cancer.

Section: Lung Cancer Risk Factors > Risk factors you cannot change > Air pollution

In cities, air pollution, such as from diesel exhaust, appears to raise the risk of lung cancer slightly. This risk is far less than the risk caused by smoking, but about 1% to 2% of all deaths from lung cancer in the United States are thought to be due to outdoor air pollution.

Section: Lung Cancer Risk Factors > Risk factors you cannot change > Personal or family history of lung cancer

If you have had lung cancer, you have a higher risk of developing another lung cancer.
Brothers, sisters, and children of people who have had lung cancer may have a slightly higher risk of lung cancer themselves, especially if the relative was diagnosed at a younger age. It’s not clear how much of this risk might be due to shared genes among family members and how much might be from shared household exposures (such as tobacco smoke or radon).
Researchers have found that genetics do play a role in some families with a strong history of lung cancer. (To learn more, see What Causes Lung Cancer?)

Section: Lung Cancer Risk Factors > Factors with uncertain or unproven effects on lung cancer risk > Smoking marijuana

---START CHUNK 284---
There are reasons to think smoking marijuana might increase lung cancer risk.
- Marijuana smoke contains tar and many of the same cancer-causing substances that are in tobacco smoke. (Tar is the sticky, solid material that remains after burning, which is thought to contain most of the harmful substances in smoke.)
- Marijuana cigarettes (joints) are typically smoked all the way to the end, where tar content is the highest.
- Marijuana is inhaled very deeply, and the smoke is held in the lungs for a long time, which gives any cancer-causing substances more opportunity to deposit in the lungs.
- Because marijuana is still illegal in many places, it may not be possible to control what other substances it might contain.

---START CHUNK 285---
- Because marijuana is still illegal in many places, it may not be possible to control what other substances it might contain.
It’s been hard to study whether there is a link between marijuana and lung cancer because marijuana has been illegal in many places for so long, and it’s not easy to gather information about the use of illegal drugs. Also, in studies that have looked at past marijuana use in people who had lung cancer, most of the people who smoked marijuana also smoked cigarettes. This can make it hard to know how much any increased risk is from tobacco and how much might be from marijuana. We do know that smoking marijuana will irritate your lungs and possibly increase your risk of getting more lung infections. More research is needed to know the cancer risks from smoking marijuana.

Section: Lung Cancer Risk Factors > Factors with uncertain or unproven effects on lung cancer risk > E-cigarettes

E-cigarettes are a type of electronic nicotine delivery system. Most e-cigarettes contain nicotine, so the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) classifies them as “tobacco products.”  The FDA states that e-cigarettes cause health risks, including lung damage. Furthermore, e-cigarettes have not been shown to improve your chances of quitting smoking. Whether e-cigarettes directly increase your risk of lung cancer is not yet known.

SCLC accounts for approximately 15% of bronchogenic carcinomas.
At the time of diagnosis, approximately 30% of patients with SCLC have tumors confined to the hemithorax of origin, mediastinum, or supraclavicular lymph nodes. These patients have limited-stage disease (LD).[1] Patients with tumors that have spread beyond the supraclavicular areas have extensive-stage disease (ED).
SCLC is more responsive to chemotherapy and radiation therapy than other cell types of lung cancer. However, a cure is difficult to achieve because SCLC has a greater tendency to be widely disseminated by the time of diagnosis.

Increasing age is the most important risk factor for most cancers. Other risk factors for lung cancer include the following:
- History of or current tobacco use: cigarettes, pipes, and cigars.[4]
- Exposure to cancer-causing substances in secondhand smoke.[5,6]
- Occupational exposure to asbestos, arsenic, chromium, beryllium, nickel, and other agents.[7]
- Radiation exposure from any of the following:
Radiation therapy to the breast or chest.[8]
Radon exposure in the home or workplace.[9]
Medical imaging tests, such as computed tomography (CT) scans.[10]
Atomic bomb radiation.[11]
- Radiation therapy to the breast or chest.[8]

---START CHUNK 307---
Lung cancer may present with symptoms or be found incidentally on chest imaging. Symptoms and signs may result from the location of the primary local invasion or compression of adjacent thoracic structures, distant metastases, or paraneoplastic phenomena. The most common symptoms at presentation are worsening cough and dyspnea. Other presenting symptoms include the following:
- Chest pain.
- Hoarseness.
- Malaise.
- Anorexia.
- Weight loss.
- Hemoptysis.
Symptoms may result from local invasion or compression of adjacent thoracic structures, such as compression involving the esophagus causing dysphagia, compression involving the laryngeal nerves causing hoarseness, or compression involving the superior vena cava causing facial edema and distension of the superficial veins of the head and neck. Symptoms from distant metastases may also be present and include neurological defects or personality changes from brain metastases and pain from bone metastases.

---START CHUNK 308---
Infrequently, patients with SCLC may present with symptoms and signs of one of the following paraneoplastic syndromes:
- Inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion.
- Cushing syndrome from secretion of adrenocorticotropic hormone.
- Paraneoplastic cerebellar degeneration.
- Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome.[2]
Physical examination may identify enlarged supraclavicular lymphadenopathy, pleural effusion or lobar collapse, unresolved pneumonia, or signs of associated disease such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

---START CHUNK 310---
Treatment options for patients are determined by histology, stage, and general health and comorbidities of the patient. Investigations of patients with suspected SCLC focus on confirming the diagnosis and determining the extent of the disease.
The procedures used to determine the presence of cancer include the following:
- History.
- Physical examination.
- Routine laboratory evaluations.
- Chest x-ray.
- Chest CT scan with infusion of contrast material.
- Biopsy.
Before a patient begins lung cancer treatment, an experienced lung cancer pathologist must review the pathological material. This is critical because SCLC, which responds well to chemotherapy and is generally not treated surgically, can be confused on microscopic examination with NSCLC.[19] Immunohistochemistry and electron microscopy are invaluable techniques for diagnosis and subclassification, but most lung tumors can be classified by light microscopic criteria.
For more information, see the Staging Evaluation section.

---START CHUNK 312---
Regardless of stage, the prognosis for patients with SCLC is unsatisfactory despite improvements in diagnosis and therapy during the past 25 years. Without treatment, SCLC has the most aggressive clinical course of any type of pulmonary tumor, with a median survival from diagnosis of only 2 to 4 months. About 10% of people with SCLC remain free of disease during the 2 years from the start of therapy, which is the time period during which most relapses occur. However, even these patients are at risk of dying of lung cancer (both small and non-small cell types).[20] The overall survival rate at 5 years is 5% to 10%.[1,20-22]

---START CHUNK 313---
An important prognostic factor for SCLC is the extent of disease. Patients with LD have a better prognosis than patients with ED. For patients with LD, the median survival is 16 to 24 months and the 5-year survival rates is 14% with current forms of treatment.[1,21,23,24] Patients diagnosed with LD who smoke should be encouraged to stop smoking before undergoing combined-modality therapy because continued smoking may compromise survival.[25]

---START CHUNK 314---
Patients with LD have improved long-term survival with combined-modality therapy.[24,26][Level of evidence A1] Although long-term survivors have been reported among patients who received either surgery or chemotherapy alone, chemotherapy combined with thoracic radiation therapy (TRT) is considered the standard of care.[27] Adding TRT increases absolute survival by approximately 5% over chemotherapy alone.[26,28] Multiple trials and meta-analyses have evaluated the optimal timing of TRT relative to chemotherapy, with the weight of evidence suggesting a small benefit to early TRT.[1,29,30][Level of evidence A1]
In patients with ED, the median survival 6 to 12 months with currently available therapy, but long-term disease-free survival is rare.

---START CHUNK 315---
In patients with ED, the median survival 6 to 12 months with currently available therapy, but long-term disease-free survival is rare.
Prophylactic cranial radiation prevents central nervous system recurrence and can improve survival in patients with good performance status who have had a complete response or a very good partial response to chemoradiation in LD or chemotherapy in ED.[31,32][Level of evidence A1]
Thoracic radiation may also improve long-term outcomes for these patients.[33]
All patients with this type of cancer may appropriately be considered for inclusion in clinical trials at the time of diagnosis. Information about ongoing clinical trials is available from the NCI website.

---START CHUNK 328---
The current classification of subtypes of SCLC includes the following:[1]
- Small cell carcinoma.
- Combined small cell carcinoma (i.e., SCLC combined with additional components from any of the non-small cell lung carcinoma histological types).
SCLC arising from neuroendocrine cells forms one extreme of the spectrum of neuroendocrine carcinomas of the lung.
Neuroendocrine tumors include the following:
- Low-grade typical carcinoid.
- Intermediate-grade atypical carcinoid.
- High-grade neuroendocrine tumors, including large-cell neuroendocrine carcinoma (LCNEC) and SCLC.

---START CHUNK 329---
- Low-grade typical carcinoid.
- Intermediate-grade atypical carcinoid.
- High-grade neuroendocrine tumors, including large-cell neuroendocrine carcinoma (LCNEC) and SCLC.
Because of differences in clinical behavior, therapy, and epidemiology, these tumors are classified separately in the World Health Organization (WHO) revised classification. The variant form of SCLC called mixed small cell/large cell carcinoma was not retained in the revised WHO classification. Instead, SCLC is now divided into SCLC and combined SCLC.[2] No minimum percentage of the additional component is required for a combined SCLC diagnosis with the exception of mixed LCNEC and SCLC, in which a 10% minimum LCNEC component is required.[3]
SCLC presents as a proliferation of small cells with the following morphological features:[4]
- Scant cytoplasm.
- Ill-defined borders.
- Finely granular salt and pepper chromatin.
- Absent or inconspicuous nucleoli.
- Frequent nuclear molding.
- A high mitotic count.

---START CHUNK 330---
- Scant cytoplasm.
- Ill-defined borders.
- Finely granular salt and pepper chromatin.
- Absent or inconspicuous nucleoli.
- Frequent nuclear molding.
- A high mitotic count.
Nearly all SCLC are immunoreactive for keratin, thyroid transcription factor 1, and epithelial membrane antigen. Neuroendocrine and neural differentiation result in the expression of dopa decarboxylase, calcitonin, neuron-specific enolase, chromogranin A, CD56 (also known as nucleosomal histone kinase 1 or neural-cell adhesion molecule), gastrin-releasing peptide, and insulin-like growth factor 1. One or more markers of neuroendocrine differentiation can be found in approximately 75% of SCLC.[5]
Although preinvasive and in situ malignant changes are frequently found in patients with non-small cell lung cancer, these findings are rare in patients with SCLC.[6]

Several staging systems have been proposed for small cell lung cancer (SCLC). These staging systems include the following:
- American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) Tumor, Node, and Metastasis (TNM).[1] The 8th edition of the AJCC Cancer Staging Manual recommends the use of the TNM to classify SCLC. For more information, see the AJCC Stage Groupings and TNM Definitions section in Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Treatment.
- Veterans Administration Lung Study Group (VALG).[2]
- International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer (IASLC).[3]

Section: Small Cell Lung Cancer Treatment (PDQ®)–Health Professional Version > Stage Information for SCLC > Limited-Stage Disease

No universally accepted definition of this term is available. Limited-stage disease (LD) SCLC is confined to the hemithorax of origin, mediastinum, or supraclavicular nodes, which can be encompassed within a tolerable radiation therapy port.
Patients with pleural effusion, massive pulmonary tumor, and contralateral supraclavicular nodes have been both included in and excluded from LD by various groups.

Extensive-stage disease (ED) SCLC has spread beyond the supraclavicular areas and is too widespread to be included within the definition of LD. Patients with distant metastases (M1) are always considered to have ED.[3,4]

---START CHUNK 339---
The AJCC TNM defines LD as any T, except for T3–4, due to multiple lung nodules that do not fit in a tolerable radiation field, any N, and M0.[1] This corresponds to TNM stages I to IIIB. Extensive disease is TNM stage IV with distant metastases (M1), including malignant pleural effusions.[3,4] For more information, see the AJCC Stage Groupings and TNM Definitions section in Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Treatment.

---START CHUNK 340---
The IASLC conducted an analysis of clinical TNM staging for SCLC using the sixth edition of the AJCC TNM staging system for lung cancer. Survival rates for patients with clinical stages I and II disease are significantly different from those for patients with stage III disease with N2 or N3 involvement.[3] Patients with pleural effusion have an intermediate prognosis between LD and ED with hematogenous metastases and will be classified as having M1 disease (or ED). Application of the TNM system will not change how patients are managed; however, the analysis suggests that, in the context of clinical trials in LD, accurate TNM staging and stratification may be important.[3]

Section: Small Cell Lung Cancer Treatment (PDQ®)–Health Professional Version > Stage Information for SCLC > Staging Evaluation

---START CHUNK 342---
Staging procedures for SCLC are important to distinguish patients with disease limited to their thorax from those with distant metastases. At the time of initial diagnosis, approximately two-thirds of patients with SCLC have clinical evidence of metastases; most of the remaining patients have clinical evidence of extensive nodal involvement in the hilar, mediastinal, and sometimes supraclavicular regions.
Determining the stage of cancer allows an assessment of prognosis and a determination of treatment, particularly when chest radiation therapy or surgical excision is added to chemotherapy for patients with LD. If ED is confirmed, further evaluation should be individualized according to the signs and symptoms unique to the individual patient. Standard staging procedures include the following:
- A thorough physical examination.
- Routine blood counts and serum chemistries.
- Chest and upper abdominal computed tomography (CT) scanning.
- A radionuclide bone scan.

---START CHUNK 343---
- A thorough physical examination.
- Routine blood counts and serum chemistries.
- Chest and upper abdominal computed tomography (CT) scanning.
- A radionuclide bone scan.
- A brain magnetic resonance imaging scan or CT scan.
- Bone marrow aspirate or biopsy in selected patients in which treatment would change based on the results.
The role of positron emission tomography (PET) is still under study. SCLC is fluorine F 18-fludeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) avid at the primary site and at metastatic sites. PET may be used in staging patients with SCLC who are potential candidates for the addition of thoracic radiation therapy to chemotherapy, as PET may lead to upstaging or downstaging of patients and to alteration of radiation fields resulting from the identification of additional sites of nodal metastases.
Evidence (18F-FDG PET):

---START CHUNK 344---
Evidence (18F-FDG PET):
- In a study of 120 patients with LD SCLC or ED SCLC, FDG-PET led to restaging of ten patients to a higher stage and three patients to a lower stage.[5] FDG-PET was more sensitive and specific than CT scans for nonbrain distant metastases.
- In a small series of 24 patients with LD by conventional staging, two patients were restaged to ED.[2] Unsuspected nodal metastases were documented in 25% of patients, which altered the radiation plan in these patients. At this time, sensitivity, specificity, and positive- or negative-predictive value of PET scanning and its enhancement of staging accuracy are uncertain.

---START CHUNK 349---
Chemotherapy improves the survival of patients with limited-stage disease (LD) or extensive-stage disease (ED), but it is curative in only a few patients.[1,2] Because patients with SCLC tend to develop distant metastases, localized forms of treatment, such as surgical resection or radiation therapy, rarely produce long-term survival.[3] Incorporating current chemotherapy regimens into the treatment program prolongs survival, with at least a fourfold to fivefold improvement in median survival compared with patients who are given no therapy.
The combination of platinum and etoposide is the most widely used standard chemotherapeutic regimen.[4-6][Level of evidence A1] No consistent survival benefit has resulted from platinum versus nonplatinum combinations, increased dose intensity or dose density, altered mode of administration (e.g., alternating or sequential administration) of various chemotherapeutic agents, or maintenance chemotherapy.[7-12][Level of evidence A1]

---START CHUNK 351---
SCLC is highly radiosensitive and thoracic radiation therapy improves survival of patients with LD and ED tumors.[13-16][Level of evidence A1] Prophylactic cranial irradiation prevents central nervous system recurrence and may improve the long-term survival of patients with good performance status who have responded to chemoradiation therapy.[17-19][Level of evidence A1] This type of irradiation also offers palliation of symptomatic metastatic disease.
Treatment options for patients with LD, ED, or recurrent SCLC are summarized in Table 1.
Despite treatment advances, most patients with SCLC die of their tumor even with the best available therapy. Most of the improvements in survival of patients with SCLC are attributable to clinical trials that have attempted to improve on the best available and most accepted therapy. Patient entry into such studies is highly desirable.
Information about ongoing clinical trials is available from the NCI website.

Combined-modality treatment with etoposide and cisplatin with thoracic radiation therapy (TRT) is the most widely used treatment for patients with limited-stage disease (LD) SCLC.
Evidence (combined-modality treatment):
- Survival. The following results have been reported in clinical trials:
Mature results of prospective randomized trials suggest that combined-modality therapy produces a modest but significant improvement in survival of 5% at 3 years compared with chemotherapy alone.[1-3][Level of evidence A1]
Clinical trials have consistently achieved median survivals of 18 to 24 months and 2-year survival rates of 40% to 50%, with a treatment-related mortality rate of less than 3%.[3-7][Level of evidence A1]
No consistent survival benefit has resulted from the following:[8-16]
Increased dose intensity.
Increased dose density.
Administration of additional drugs or other (non–etoposide-containing) platinum-based combination regimens.

- Maintenance chemotherapy.
- Length of treatment. The optimal duration of chemotherapy for patients with LD SCLC is not clearly defined, but no improvement exists in survival after the duration of drug administration exceeds 3 to 6 months. The preponderance of evidence available from randomized trials indicates that maintenance chemotherapy does not prolong survival for patients with LD SCLC.[8-15][Level of evidence A1]
- Dose and timing. The optimal dose and timing of TRT remain controversial.

---START CHUNK 365---
- Dose and timing. The optimal dose and timing of TRT remain controversial.
Multiple clinical trials and meta-analyses addressing the timing of TRT have been published, with the weight of evidence suggesting a small benefit to early TRT (i.e., TRT administered during the first or second cycle of chemotherapy administration).[3-6,8,9,15,17-20][Level of evidence A1]
The amount of time from start to completion of TRT in LD SCLC may also affect overall survival (OS). In an analysis of four trials, the completion of therapy in less than 30 days was associated with an improved 5-year survival rate (relative risk, 0.62; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.49–0.80; P = .0003).[20][Level of evidence A1]
Both once-daily and twice-daily chest radiation schedules have been used in regimens with etoposide and cisplatin.

The phase III CONVERT study (NCT00433563) randomly assigned patients to receive either 45 Gy radiation therapy in 30 twice-daily fractions of 1.5 Gy over 19 days or 66 Gy in 33 once-daily fractions of 2 Gy over 45 days, starting on day 22 after commencing cisplatin-etoposide chemotherapy (given as four to six cycles every 3 weeks in both groups).[21] The primary end point was OS, defined as time from randomization until death from any cause, analyzed by modified intention-to-treat. A 12% higher OS at 2 years in the once-daily group versus the twice-daily group was considered clinically significant to show superiority of the once-daily regimen.
At a median follow-up of 45 months (interquartile range [IQR], 35–58), median OS was 30 months (95% CI, 24–34) in the twice-daily group versus 25 months (95% CI, 21–31) in the once-daily group (hazard ratio for death in the once-daily group, 1.18 [95% CI, 0.95–1.45]; P = .14).

---START CHUNK 368---
The two-year OS rate was 56% (95% CI, 50%–62%) in the twice-daily group and 51% (45%–57%) in the once-daily group (absolute difference between the treatment groups, 5.3% [95% CI, -3.2% to 13.7%]).
Most toxicities were similar between the groups, except there was significantly more grade 4 neutropenia with twice-daily radiation therapy (129 [49%] vs. 101 [38%]; P = .05). In contrast to the earlier study, there was no difference between the groups in terms of rates of grade 3 to 4 esophagitis or pneumonitis.
Twice-daily radiation therapy has not been broadly adopted. Once-daily fractions to doses higher than 60 Gy are feasible and commonly used; their clinical benefits are yet to be defined in phase III trials.[21][Level of evidence A1]

---START CHUNK 369---
- Multiple clinical trials and meta-analyses addressing the timing of TRT have been published, with the weight of evidence suggesting a small benefit to early TRT (i.e., TRT administered during the first or second cycle of chemotherapy administration).[3-6,8,9,15,17-20][Level of evidence A1]
- The amount of time from start to completion of TRT in LD SCLC may also affect overall survival (OS). In an analysis of four trials, the completion of therapy in less than 30 days was associated with an improved 5-year survival rate (relative risk, 0.62; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.49–0.80; P = .0003).[20][Level of evidence A1]

---START CHUNK 379---
- ADRIATIC (NCT03703297) was a phase III, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter, global study, published in abstract form, that assessed durvalumab with or without tremelimumab as consolidation treatment for patients with LD SCLC. Patients had stage I to III disease (inoperable if stage I or II) that had not progressed after chemoradiation therapy. PCI was permitted before randomization. Patients were randomly assigned 1 to 42 days after concurrent chemoradiation therapy to receive durvalumab (1,500 mg) plus placebo, durvalumab (1,500 mg) plus tremelimumab (75 mg), or placebo plus placebo every 4 weeks for four cycles, followed by durvalumab or placebo every 4 weeks until investigator-determined progression or intolerable toxicity, or for a maximum of 24 months. The dual primary end points were OS and progression-free survival (PFS) per blinded independent central review for durvalumab versus placebo.

dual primary end points were OS and progression-free survival (PFS) per blinded independent central review for durvalumab versus placebo. The trial randomly assigned 730 patients, including 264 to receive durvalumab and 266 to receive placebo. The abstract was published after the first planned interim analysis of durvalumab versus placebo.[22]

---START CHUNK 381---
The median duration of follow-up was 37.2 months for OS and 27.6 months for PFS.[22][Level of evidence A1]
The median OS was 55.9 months in the durvalumab arm (95% CI, 37.3–not estimable) and 33.4 months in the placebo arm (95% CI, 25.5–39.9). The 24-month OS rate was 68.0% in the durvalumab arm and 58.5% in the placebo arm. The 36-month OS rate was 56.5% in the durvalumab arm and 47.6% in the placebo arm.
The median PFS was 16.6 months in the durvalumab arm (95% CI, 10.2–28.2) and 9.2 months (95% CI, 7.4–12.9) in the placebo arm. The 18-month PFS rate was 48.8% in the durvalumab arm and 36.1% in the placebo arm. The 24-month PFS rate was 46.2% in the durvalumab arm and 34.2% in the placebo arm.

---START CHUNK 382---
Grade 3 or 4 all-cause adverse events occurred in 24.3% of patients in the durvalumab arm and 24.2% of patients in the placebo arm.

Patients with a contraindication to radiation therapy may receive chemotherapy alone. Patients presenting with superior vena cava syndrome are treated immediately with combination chemotherapy, radiation therapy, or both, depending on the severity of presentation.[23,24] For more information, see Cardiopulmonary Syndromes.

---START CHUNK 387---
The role of surgery in the management of patients with SCLC is unproven. Small case series and population studies have reported favorable outcomes for the minority of LD patients with very limited disease, with small tumors pathologically confined to the lung of origin or the lung and ipsilateral hilar lymph nodes from surgical resection with adjuvant chemotherapy.[25-29][Level of evidence C2] Patients who have undergone surgery and then been diagnosed with SCLC generally receive adjuvant chemotherapy with or without radiation therapy. In patients who receive chemotherapy with radiation therapy, there is no improvement in survival with the addition of surgery.[29][Level of evidence C2] Given the absence of data from randomized trials, the potential benefits and risks of surgery in the management of individual patients with SCLC must be considered.
Evidence (role of surgery):

---START CHUNK 390---
Patients who have achieved a complete remission may receive PCI. Patients whose cancer can be controlled outside the brain have a 60% actuarial risk of developing central nervous system (CNS) metastases within 2 to 3 years after starting treatment.[29,31,32] Most of these patients have disease that relapses only in the brain, and nearly all of those with CNS relapse die of their cranial metastases. The risk of developing CNS metastases can be reduced by more than 50% with the administration of PCI.[31]
Evidence (role of PCI):
- A meta-analysis of seven randomized trials evaluated the value of PCI for patients in complete remission. The addition of PCI improved the rates of brain recurrence, disease-free survival, and OS. The 3-year OS rate increased from 15% to 21% with PCI.[31][Level of evidence A1]

---START CHUNK 391---
- The randomized RTOG-0212 study (NCT00005062) included 720 patients with LD SCLC in complete remission after chemoradiation therapy. The trial demonstrated that standard-dose PCI (25 Gy in 10 fractions) was as effective as, and less toxic than, higher doses of brain radiation.[33]
- Randomized trials such as RTOG-0212 (NCT00005062) showed that doses higher than 25 Gy in 10 daily fractions do not improve long-term survival.[33-35]

---START CHUNK 393---
Retrospective studies have shown that long-term survivors of SCLC (>2 years from the start of treatment) have a high incidence of CNS impairment.[29,32,36-38] Prospective studies have shown that patients treated with PCI do not have significantly worse neuropsychological function than patients not treated with PCI.[38] Most patients with SCLC have neuropsychological abnormalities before the start of PCI and have no detectable neurological decline for as long as 2 years after the start of PCI.[38] Patients treated for SCLC continue to have declining neuropsychological function after 2 years from the start of treatment.[36-38] Additional neuropsychological testing of patients beyond 2 years from the start of treatment is needed before concluding that PCI does not contribute to the decline in intellectual function.

---START CHUNK 395---
The optimal therapeutic approach in older patients remains unclear. A population analysis showed that increasing age was associated with decreased performance status and increased comorbidity.[39] Older patients were less likely to be treated with combined chemoradiation therapy, more intensive chemotherapy, and PCI. Older patients were also less likely to respond to therapy and had poorer survival outcomes. Whether these findings were a result of age and its associated comorbidities or suboptimal treatment delivery remains uncertain.

---START CHUNK 396---
No specific phase III trial in older patients with LD SCLC has been reported. However, three secondary analyses of two cooperative group trials evaluating outcomes in patients aged 70 years or older have been published.[40-42] The survival outcomes for the older patients were identical to those of their younger counterparts in both trials. The older patients experienced more toxic effects, particularly hematological, compared with younger patients. There was a significant increase in treatment-related mortality in the EST-3588 trial that compared etoposide and cisplatin with either once-daily or twice-daily radiation therapy (1% for patients aged <70 years vs. 10% for patients aged ≥70 years; P = .01).[41] Because the older patients enrolled in these phase III trials may not be representative of LD SCLC patients in the general population, caution must be exercised in extrapolating these results to the general population of older patients.

---START CHUNK 415---
Studies have evaluated the role of immune checkpoint inhibitors (programmed cell death-1 [PD-1] or programmed death-ligand 1 [PD-L1] inhibitors) in frontline treatment of patients with ED SCLC. Two PD-L1 inhibitors, atezolizumab and durvalumab, prolonged overall survival (OS) when combined with platinum and etoposide, compared with the same combination chemotherapy regimen alone. For more information, see the Combination chemotherapy section. Treatment with a PD-1 inhibitor, pembrolizumab, in combination with chemotherapy, did not meet statistical significance for the prespecified end point of OS in the KEYNOTE-604 (NCT03066778) phase III trial.[1][Level of evidence B1]
Evidence (immune checkpoint modulation and combination chemotherapy):

---START CHUNK 416---
Evidence (immune checkpoint modulation and combination chemotherapy):
- Atezolizumab. IMpower133 (NCT02763579), a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, phase III trial, compared four cycles of carboplatin and etoposide with either atezolizumab (n = 201) or placebo (n = 202), followed by maintenance with either atezolizumab or placebo (as per the original randomization) until unacceptable toxic effects, disease progression, or no additional benefit.[2]
At the planned interim analysis for OS, with a median follow-up of 22.9 months, the median OS was 12.3 months in the atezolizumab group and 10.3 months in the placebo group (hazard ratio [HR] for death, 0.76; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.60−0.95; descriptive P = .0154).[2][Level of evidence A1]
The median progression-free survival (PFS) was 5.2 months for the atezolizumab group and 4.3 months for the placebo group (HR for disease progression or death, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.63−0.95; P = .02).

The median progression-free survival (PFS) was 5.2 months for the atezolizumab group and 4.3 months for the placebo group (HR for disease progression or death, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.63−0.95; P = .02).
The toxicity event rate was similar for both arms, consistent with known adverse events of the individual agents. Grade 3 or 4 adverse events occurred in 56.6% of patients in the atezolizumab group and 56.1% of patients in the placebo group.

- Durvalumab. CASPIAN (NCT03043872) was a randomized, open-label, phase III trial that assigned patients to durvalumab plus platinum-etoposide (n = 268), durvalumab plus tremelimumab (a cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen-4 [CTLA-4] inhibitor) plus platinum-etoposide (n = 268), or platinum-etoposide alone (n = 269). In the immunotherapy arms, patients received four cycles of platinum-etoposide plus durvalumab with or without tremelimumab, followed by durvalumab maintenance until intolerance or disease progression or until other discontinuation criteria were met. In the chemotherapy-alone arm, up to six cycles of chemotherapy could be given, as well as PCI, at the investigator’s discretion. At the time of planned interim OS analysis, the durvalumab plus platinum-etoposide group met the predefined threshold for statistical significance.[3]

---START CHUNK 420---
The median OS was 12.9 months in the durvalumab plus platinum-etoposide group versus 10.5 months in the platinum-etoposide group (HR for OS, 0.75; 95% CI, 0.62−0.91; nominal P = .0032).[3][Level of evidence A1]

---START CHUNK 422---
Chemotherapy for patients with ED SCLC is commonly given as a two-drug combination of platinum and etoposide in doses associated with at least moderate toxic effects (as in limited-stage [LD] SCLC).[4] Cisplatin is associated with significant toxic effects and requires fluid hydration, which can be problematic in patients with cardiovascular disease. Carboplatin is active in SCLC, is dosed according to renal function, and is associated with less nonhematological toxic effects.
Other regimens appear to produce similar survival outcomes but have been studied less extensively or are in less common use.
Doses and schedules used in current programs yield overall response rates of 50% to 80% and complete response rates of 0% to 30% in patients with ED SCLC.[5,6][Level of evidence A1]

Intracranial metastases from small cell carcinoma may respond to chemotherapy as readily as metastases in other organs.[7,8]
Evidence (standard regimens):
- Two meta-analyses evaluated the role of platinum combinations versus nonplatinum combinations.
A Cochrane analysis did not identify a difference in 6-, 12-, or 24-month survival.[9]
A meta-analysis of 19 trials published between 1981 and 1999 showed a significant survival advantage for patients receiving platinum-based chemotherapy compared with those receiving a nonplatinum agent.[6][Level of evidence A1]

- The Hellenic Oncology Group conducted a phase III trial comparing cisplatin and etoposide with carboplatin plus etoposide.[10] The median survival was 11.8 months in the cisplatin arm and 12.5 months in the carboplatin arm.[10][Level of evidence A1] Although this difference was not statistically significant, the trial was underpowered to prove equivalence of the two treatment regimens in patients with either LD or ED.
Evidence (other combination chemotherapy regimens):

---START CHUNK 425---
Evidence (other combination chemotherapy regimens):
- Irinotecan. Five trials and two meta-analyses have evaluated the combination of etoposide and cisplatin versus irinotecan and cisplatin. Only one of the trials showed the superiority of the irinotecan-and-cisplatin combination.[11][Level of evidence A1] Subsequent trials and the meta-analyses support that the regimens provide equivalent clinical benefit with differing toxicity profiles.[12-17][Level of evidence A1] Irinotecan-and-cisplatin regimens led to less grade 3 to 4 anemia, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia but more grade 3 to 4 vomiting and diarrhea than etoposide-and-cisplatin regimens. Treatment-related deaths were comparable between the two groups.

---START CHUNK 426---
- Topotecan. In a randomized trial of 784 patients, the combination of oral topotecan given with cisplatin for 5 days was not superior to etoposide and cisplatin.[18] The 1-year survival rate was 31% (95% CI, 27%–36%) and was deemed to be noninferior, as the difference of -0.03 met the predefined criteria of no more than 10% absolute difference in 1-year survival.[18][Level of evidence A1]
- Paclitaxel. No consistent survival benefit has resulted from the addition of paclitaxel to etoposide and cisplatin.[19,20]
Evidence (duration of treatment):
- The optimal duration of chemotherapy is not clearly defined, but no obvious improvement in survival occurs when the duration of drug administration exceeds 6 months.[10,21,22]

---START CHUNK 427---
- The optimal duration of chemotherapy is not clearly defined, but no obvious improvement in survival occurs when the duration of drug administration exceeds 6 months.[10,21,22]
- Reported data from randomized trials show no clear evidence that maintenance chemotherapy improves survival duration.[23-25][Level of evidence A1] However, a meta-analysis of 14 published randomized trials assessing the benefit of duration/maintenance therapy reported an odds ratio of 0.67 for both 1- and 2-year OS (95% CI, 0.56–0.79; P < .001 for 1-year OS and 0.53–0.86; P < .001 for 2-year OS). This corresponded to an increase of 9% in 1-year OS and 4% in 2-year OS.[26][Level of evidence A1]
Evidence (dose intensification):

---START CHUNK 428---
Evidence (dose intensification):
- The role of dose intensification in patients with SCLC remains unclear.[27-31] Early studies showed that under-treatment compromised outcome and suggested that early dose intensification may improve survival.[27,28] A number of clinical trials have examined the use of colony-stimulating factors to support dose-intensified chemotherapy in SCLC.[29-37] These studies have yielded conflicting results.
Four studies have shown that a modest increase in dose intensity (25%–34%) was associated with a significant improvement in survival, with no compromise in quality of life (QOL).[29-32][Level of evidence A1]
Two of three studies that examined combinations of the variables of interval, dose per cycle, and number of cycles showed no advantage.[32-35][Level of evidence A1]

) reported a randomized comparison of standard-dose cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and etoposide given every 3 weeks for five cycles versus intensified treatment given at 125% of the dose every 2 weeks for four cycles with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) support.[35] The median dose intensity delivered was 70% higher in the experimental arm; the median cumulative dose was similar in both arms. There was no difference between treatment groups in median or 2-year survival.

---START CHUNK 430---
A randomized phase III trial compared ifosfamide, cisplatin, and etoposide (ICE), which was given every 4 weeks, with twice weekly ICE with G-CSF and autologous blood support.[36] Despite achieving a relative dose intensity of 1.84 in the dose-accelerated arm, there was no difference in response rate (88% vs. 80%, respectively), median survival (14.4 vs. 13.9 months, respectively), or 2-year survival (19% vs. 22%, respectively) for dose-dense treatment compared with standard treatment.[36][Level of evidence A1] Patients who received dose-dense treatment spent less time on treatment and had fewer episodes of infection.
A randomized phase II study of identical design reported a significantly better median survival for the dose-dense arm (29.8 vs. 17.4 months, respectively; P = .02) and 2-year survival (62% vs. 36%, respectively; P = .05).[37] However, given the small study size (only 70 patients), these results should be viewed with caution.

- Performance status.
More patients with ED SCLC have greatly impaired performance status at the time of diagnosis than patients with LD. Such patients have a poor prognosis and tolerate aggressive chemotherapy or combined-modality therapy poorly. Single-agent intravenous, oral, and low-dose biweekly regimens have been developed for these patients.[33,38-44]
Prospective randomized studies have shown that patients with a poor prognosis who are treated with conventional regimens live longer than those treated with single-agent, low-dose regimens or abbreviated courses of therapy. A study comparing chemotherapy every 3 weeks with treatment given as required for symptom control showed an improvement in QOL in patients receiving regular treatment.[41][Level of evidence B1]

- Age.
Subgroup analyses of phase II and III trials of patients with SCLC by age showed that myelosuppression and doxorubicin-induced cardiac toxic effects were more severe in older patients than in younger patients, and that the incidence of treatment-related death tended to be higher in older patients.[44] About 80% of older patients, however, received optimal treatment, and their survival was comparable with that of younger patients. The standard chemotherapy regimens for the general population could be applied to older patients in good general condition (i.e., performance status of 0–1, normal organ function, and no comorbidity). There is no evidence of a difference in response rate, disease-free survival (DFS), or OS in older patients compared with younger patients.

Radiation therapy to sites of metastatic disease unlikely to be immediately palliated by chemotherapy, especially brain, epidural, and bone metastases, is a standard treatment option for patients with ED SCLC. Brain metastases are treated with whole-brain radiation therapy.
Chest radiation therapy is sometimes given for superior vena cava syndrome, but chemotherapy alone, with radiation reserved for nonresponding patients, is appropriate initial treatment. For more information, see Cardiopulmonary Syndromes.

---START CHUNK 446---
Patients with ED treated with chemotherapy who have achieved a response can be considered for administration of PCI.
Evidence (PCI):
- A randomized trial of 286 patients who responded after four to six cycles of chemotherapy compared PCI with no further therapy.[46][Level of evidence B1 
The cumulative risk of brain metastases within 1 year was 14.6% in the radiation group (95% CI, 8.3%–20.9%) and 40.4% in the control group (95% CI, 32.1%– 48.6%).
Radiation was associated with an increase in median DFS from 12.0 weeks to 14.7 weeks and in median OS from 5.4 months to 6.7 months after randomization.
The 1-year survival rate was 27.1% (95% CI, 19.4%–35.5%) in the radiation group and 13.3% (95% CI, 8.1%–19.9%) in the control group.[46]
Radiation had side effects but did not have a clinically significant effect on global health status.[46]
Only 29% of the randomly assigned patients had brain imaging at diagnosis.[47]

---START CHUNK 468---
Treatment options for patients with recurrent small cell lung cancer (SCLC) include the following:
- Chemotherapy.
Topotecan.
Lurbinectedin.
Other chemotherapy agents.
- Topotecan.
- Lurbinectedin.
- Other chemotherapy agents.
- Immunotherapy.
Tarlatamab.
- Tarlatamab.
- Immune checkpoint modulation.
- Palliative therapy.
- Phase I and II clinical trials evaluating new drugs, including bispecific T-cell engager (BiTE) immunotherapies.
At the time of recurrence, many patients with SCLC are potential candidates for further therapy.
For patients with recurrent SCLC, immune checkpoint modulation with anti–programmed death-ligand 1 (anti–PD-L1) antibodies may lead to durable responses either as single agents or in combination with cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen-4 (anti–CTLA-4). Impacts on long-term survival from these approaches are being assessed in randomized trials.

---START CHUNK 470---
Although second-line chemotherapy has produced tumor regression, responses are usually short lived. The median survival is rarely more than 12 months and usually less than 6 months after second-line therapy.[1] Response to first-line chemotherapy predicts subsequent response to second-line therapy.

---START CHUNK 471---
As in other chemosensitive tumors (e.g., Hodgkin lymphoma and ovarian epithelial cancer), two main categories of patients receiving second-line chemotherapy have been described: sensitive and resistant. Sensitive patients have a first-line response that lasted more than 90 days after treatment was completed. These patients have the greatest benefit from second-line chemotherapy. Patients with sensitive disease respond to the same initial regimen in approximately 50% of cases; however, cumulative toxic effects may ensue.[2] Resistant patients either did not respond to first-line chemotherapy or responded initially but relapsed within 90 days of completion of their primary therapy.[3] Results from phase II studies of drugs such as topotecan, irinotecan, and gemcitabine indicate that response rates to agents vary depending on whether patients have sensitive, resistant, or refractory disease.[4-8][Level of evidence C2]

---START CHUNK 472---
Topotecan is a standard chemotherapy for recurrent SCLC.[9,10] Lurbinectedin, a selective inhibitor of oncogenic transcription, is another option.[11] Patients with sensitive disease may achieve response to a number of agents including topotecan, irinotecan, taxanes, vinorelbine, paclitaxel, or gemcitabine.[4-8,12-14][Level of evidence C2] Response rates for combination agents are generally higher than those reported for single agents,[15,16] and one phase III study reported improved survival for patients with sensitive disease treated with combination cisplatin, etoposide, and irinotecan. However, higher rates of toxicity have been seen.[17]

---START CHUNK 474---
Evidence (topotecan and other chemotherapy agents):
- A randomized comparison of second-line treatment with either cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and vincristine or topotecan in patients with sensitive disease reported no significant difference in response rates or survival. However, palliation of common lung cancer symptoms was better with topotecan.[9][Level of evidence A3]
- A phase III trial comparing chemotherapy with best supportive care (BSC) in patients with relapsed SCLC demonstrated that the addition of oral topotecan to BSC significantly increased overall survival (OS) and resulted in better symptom control compared with BSC alone.[10][Level of evidence A1] The study enrolled 141 patients with chemosensitive or chemoresistant relapsed SCLC who were unsuitable for further standard intravenous chemotherapy. The median survivals for patients receiving topotecan plus BSC were 25.9 weeks versus 13.9 weeks for BSC alone (P = .01).[10]

---START CHUNK 475---
- A randomized phase III trial (CWRU-SKF-1598 [NCT00003917]) of 304 patients assessed the use of oral topotecan (2.3 mg/m2/day for 5 days every 21 days) or intravenous topotecan (1.5 mg/m2/day for 5 days every 21 days). Confirmed response rates were 18.3% and 21.9%, respectively.[12][Level of evidence B1] Secondary end points of median survival and 1-year survival rates were also similar (33 weeks vs. 35 weeks and 33% vs. 29%, respectively). Patients receiving oral topotecan experienced less grade 4 neutropenia (47% vs. 64.2%) but more diarrhea of all grades (35.9% vs. 19.9%) than with intravenous topotecan. Quality-of-life (QOL) analysis (using a nonvalidated QOL questionnaire) demonstrated no significant difference between the two arms.

Evidence (other chemotherapy agents):
- A phase III trial (University Hospital Medical Information Network Clinical Trials Registry [UMIN000000828]) in Japan included 180 patients with extensive-stage SCLC, who had responded to first-line platinum-doublet chemotherapy but had their disease progress more than 90 days after completion of chemotherapy. Patients were randomly assigned 1:1 to receive intravenous topotecan for four cycles, which is the standard of care, or five 2-week cycles of cisplatin, etoposide, and irinotecan.[17]
The primary end point of OS was significantly prolonged with the combination of cisplatin, etoposide, and irinotecan (18.2 months; 95% CI, 15.7–20.6) compared with topotecan alone (12.5 months; 95% CI, 10.8–14.9; hazard ratio, 0.67; 90% CI, 0.51–0.88; P = .0079).

---START CHUNK 481---
Rates of grade 3 to 4 toxicities were higher in patients treated with the combination regimen. Toxicities included febrile neutropenia (31% for the combination arm vs. 7% for topotecan alone) and thrombocytopenia (41% for the combination arm vs. 28% for topotecan alone).[17][Level of evidence A1]

---START CHUNK 483---
Tarlatamab is a BiTE immunotherapy drug that targets delta-like ligand 3 (DLL3) and CD3. BiTE technology is a targeted immuno-oncology platform designed to engage a patient's own T cells to any tumor-specific antigen, activating the cytotoxic potential of T cells to eliminate detectable cancer.
Evidence (tarlatamab):
- The phase II DeLLphi-301 trial (NCT05060016) evaluated the efficacy and safety of two doses of tarlatamab (10 mg or 100 mg every 2 weeks) in 220 patients with previously treated SCLC. Patients had previously received a median of two lines of treatment. The primary end point was objective response rate by blinded independent central review.[18]
The objective response rates were 40% (97.5% CI, 29%–52%) for patients who received 10 mg of tarlatamab and 32% (97.5% CI, 21%–44%) for patients who received 100 mg of tarlatamab. The median duration of response was not reached.

---START CHUNK 484---
The median progression-free survival was 4.9 months (95% CI, 2.9–6.7) with 10 mg of tarlatamab and 3.9 months (95% CI, 2.6–4.4) with 100 mg of tarlatamab.
The most common adverse events were cytokine release syndrome (51% with 10 mg, 61% with 100 mg), decreased appetite, pyrexia, constipation, and anemia.
Cytokine release syndrome occurred after the first one to two doses and was managed with supportive care.
Neurological adverse events suggestive of immune effector cell–associated neurotoxicity syndrome were higher for patients who received 100 mg (28%) compared with patients who received 10 mg (8%).
The 10-mg dose showed improved tolerability over the 100-mg dose, with similar efficacy.

Early phase Ib and II trials showed objective response rates of 10% to 33% with nivolumab or pembrolizumab treatment in patients with disease progression after one or more lines of chemotherapy, resulting in accelerated approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. However, both agents were voluntarily withdrawn after subsequent trials failed to confirm benefit.[19,20]

---START CHUNK 488---
Patients with central nervous system (CNS) recurrences can often obtain palliation of symptoms with additional chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy. A retrospective review showed that 43% of patients had disease response when treated with additional chemotherapy at the time of CNS relapse.[21] Most patients treated with radiation therapy obtain objective responses and improvement after radiation therapy.[22]
Some patients with intrinsic endobronchial obstructing lesions or extrinsic compression caused by the tumor have achieved successful palliation with endobronchial laser therapy (for endobronchial lesions only) and/or brachytherapy.[23] Expandable metal stents can be safely inserted under local anesthesia via the bronchoscope, which results in improved symptoms and pulmonary function in patients with malignant airways obstruction.[24]

---START CHUNK 489---
Patients with progressive intrathoracic tumor after failing initial chemotherapy can achieve significant tumor responses, palliation of symptoms, and short-term local control with external-beam radiation therapy. Only the rare patient, however, will experience long-term survival after receiving salvage radiation therapy.[25]

Section: Surgery for Small Cell Lung Cancer

Surgery is rarely used as part of the main treatment for small cell lung cancer (SCLC), as the cancer has usually already spread by the time it is found.
In fewer than 1 out of 20 people with SCLC, the cancer is found as only a single lung tumor, with no spread to lymph nodes or other organs. Surgery may be an option for these early-stage cancers, usually followed by additional treatment (chemotherapy and/or immunotherapy).

Section: Surgery for Small Cell Lung Cancer > Tests before lung surgery

If your doctor thinks the lung cancer can be treated with surgery you might need more tests, such as:
- Pulmonary function tests (PFTs) to see if you would have enough healthy lung tissue left after surgery.
- EKG (recording of your heart’s electrical activity) and an echocardiogram (ultrasound of your heart) to check the function of your heart
- Blood work or other studies to be sure you’re healthy enough for surgery.
Your doctor will want to check if the cancer has already spread to the lymph nodes between the lungs. This is often done before surgery with mediastinoscopy or another technique.
To learn more about these tests, see Tests for Lung Cancer.

Section: Surgery for Small Cell Lung Cancer > Types of lung surgery

---START CHUNK 519---
There are different types of lung resection, including:
- Pneumonectomy: This surgery removes an entire lung. This might be needed if the tumor is close to the center of the chest.
- Lobectomy: The lungs are made up of 5 lobes (3 in the right lung and 2 in the left). In this surgery, the entire lobe containing the tumor(s) is removed. If it can be done, this is often the preferred type of operation for SCLC.
- Segmentectomy or wedge resection: In these operations, only the part of the lobe with the tumor is removed. This approach might be used if a person doesn’t have enough normal lung function to withstand removing the whole lobe.

---START CHUNK 520---
- Sleeve resection: This operation may be used to treat some cancers in large airways in the lungs. If you think of the large airway with a tumor as similar to the sleeve of a shirt with a stain a few inches above the wrist, the sleeve resection would be like cutting across the sleeve (airway) above and below the stain (tumor) and then sewing the cuff back onto the shortened sleeve. A surgeon may be able to do this operation instead of a pneumonectomy to preserve more lung function.
The type of operation your doctor recommends depends on the size and location of the tumor and on how well your lungs are functioning. Doctors often prefer to do a more extensive operation (for example, a lobectomy instead of a segmentectomy) if a person’s lungs are healthy enough, as it may provide a better chance to cure the cancer.

Section: Surgery for Small Cell Lung Cancer > Ways to do lung surgery

There are primarily 2 ways to do lung surgery: open lung surgery (thoracotomy) or minimally invasive surgery. Minimally invasive surgery includes mainly 2 types: video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) and robotic-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (RATS). With any of these surgeries, the goal could be to diagnose (to get more tissue for diagnosis), stage (to look at nearby lymph nodes for possible spread of cancer), and/or treat lung cancer (to remove all known cancer in the lung). They all require general anesthesia, where you are in a deep sleep.

Section: Surgery for Small Cell Lung Cancer > Ways to do lung surgery > Open lung surgery (Thoracotomy)

In a thoracotomy, the surgeon makes a large cut between the ribs. Where the cut is depends on which part of the lung needs to be removed. In general, the surgeon will spread the ribs to see the lung and nearby organs inside.

Section: Surgery for Small Cell Lung Cancer > Ways to do lung surgery > Video-assisted thoracic surgery (VATS)

Video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) uses smaller incisions and typically has a shorter hospital stay and fewer complications than a thoracotomy. The cure rate after this surgery seems to be the same as with surgery done with a larger incision. But it’s important that the surgeon doing this procedure is experienced, because it requires a great deal of skill.

Section: Surgery for Small Cell Lung Cancer > Ways to do lung surgery > Robotic-assisted thoracic surgery (RATS)

In this approach, the thoracoscopy is done using a robotic system. The surgeon sits at a control panel in the operating room and moves robotic arms to operate through several small incisions in the patient’s chest.
RATS is similar to VATS in terms of less pain, less blood loss, and shorter recovery time.
For the surgeon, the robotic system may provide more maneuverability and more precision when moving the instruments than standard VATS. Still, the most important factor in the success of either type of thoracoscopic surgery is the surgeon’s experience and skill.

Section: Surgery for Small Cell Lung Cancer > Intraoperative imaging

Along with the results of imaging tests (such as CT scans) done before surgery, surgeons also rely on what they can see and feel during the operation to help determine which parts of the lung need to be removed. However, some lung tumors might not be easily seen or felt, so in some situations it’s possible that a tumor (or parts of tumor) might be missed.
Your surgeon might use a special intraoperative imaging system during the surgery to help find tumors that aren’t easily seen or felt. For this approach, a fluorescent drug called pafolacianine (Cytalux) is injected into your blood within 24 hours before your surgery. The drug travels through your body and attaches to a specific protein found on lung cancer cells. Once in the operating room, the imaging system gives off near-infrared light that causes the drug to light up, which can help the surgeon see which areas of the lung need to be removed.

---START CHUNK 527---
The most common side effects after getting pafolacianine are belly pain, heartburn, itching, chest pain, nausea, vomiting, and flushing. Your doctor will probably ask you to avoid any supplements that have folic acid in them for a few days before the procedure because they might affect how well this drug works.

Section: Surgery for Small Cell Lung Cancer > Possible risks and side effects of lung surgery

---START CHUNK 529---
Surgery for lung cancer is a major operation and can have serious side effects, which is why surgery isn’t a good idea for everyone. While all surgeries carry some risks, they depend to some degree on the extent of the surgery and a person’s overall health.
Possible complications during and soon after surgery can include reactions to anesthesia, excess bleeding, blood clots in the legs or lungs, wound infections, and pneumonia. While it is rare, in some cases people might not survive the surgery.
Recovering from lung cancer surgery typically takes weeks to months. When the surgery is done through a thoracotomy, the surgeon must spread the ribs to get to the lung, so the area near the incision may hurt for some time after surgery. Your activity might be limited for at least a month or two.

---START CHUNK 530---
If your lungs are in good condition (other than the presence of the cancer) you can usually return to normal activities after some time if a lobe or even an entire lung has been removed. If you also have another lung disease such as emphysema or chronic bronchitis (which are common among people who have smoked for a long time), you might become short of breath with activity after surgery.

Section: Surgery for Small Cell Lung Cancer > After surgery

When you wake up from surgery, you will have a tube (or tubes) coming out of your chest and attached to a special container to allow excess fluid and air to drain out. The tube(s) will be removed once the fluid drainage and air leak slow down enough. Generally, you will spend about 1 to 7 days in the hospital depending on the type of surgery.

Section: Surgery for Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer

Surgery to remove the cancer might be an option for early-stage non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). It provides the best chance to cure the disease. Still, lung cancer surgery is a complex operation that can have serious consequences, so it should be done by a thoracic surgeon who has a lot of experience operating on lung cancers.

Section: Surgery for Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer > Tests before lung surgery

If your doctor thinks the cancer can be treated with surgery, you might need certain tests:
- Pulmonary function tests (PFTs) to see if you would still have enough healthy lung tissue left after surgery
- An EKG (recording of your heart’s electrical activity) and an echocardiogram (ultrasound of your heart) to check the function of your heart
- Lab work to check other organs to be sure you’re healthy enough for surgery
Your doctor will also want to check if the cancer has already spread to the lymph nodes around the lungs. This is often done before surgery with mediastinoscopy or another technique.
To learn more about these tests, see Tests for Lung Cancer.

Section: Surgery for Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer > Types of lung surgery

---START CHUNK 547---
Surgery for lung cancer usually involves removing all or part of a lung. This is called lung resection. There are different types of lung resection:
- Pneumonectomy: This surgery removes an entire lung. This might be needed if the tumor is close to the center of the chest.
- Lobectomy: The lungs are made up of 5 lobes (3 on the right lung and 2 on the left lung). In this surgery, the entire lobe containing the tumor(s) is removed. If it can be done, this is often the preferred type of operation for NSCLC.
- Segmentectomy or wedge resection: In these surgeries, only part of a lobe is removed. This approach might be used if a person doesn’t have enough normal lung function to withstand removing the whole lobe.

---START CHUNK 548---
- Sleeve resection: This operation may be used to treat some cancers in large airways in the lungs. If you think of the large airway with a tumor as similar to the sleeve of a shirt with a stain a few inches above the wrist, the sleeve resection would be like cutting across the sleeve (airway) above and below the stain (tumor) and then sewing the cuff back onto the shortened sleeve. A surgeon may be able to do this operation instead of a pneumonectomy to preserve more lung function.
The type of operation you have depends on the size and location of the tumor and on how well your lungs are functioning. Doctors often prefer to do a more extensive operation (for example, a lobectomy instead of a segmentectomy) if a person’s lungs are healthy enough, as it may provide a better chance to cure the cancer.

Section: Surgery for Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer > Ways to do lung surgery

There are 2 main ways to do lung surgery: open lung surgery (thoracotomy) and minimally invasive surgery. Minimally invasive surgery includes mainly 2 types: video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) and robotic-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (RATS). With any of these surgeries, the goal could be to diagnose (to get more tissue for diagnosis), stage (to look at nearby lymph nodes for possible spread of cancer), and/or treat lung cancer (to remove all known cancer in the lung). All surgeries require general anesthesia, which puts you in a deep sleep.

Section: Surgery for Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer > Ways to do lung surgery > Open lung surgery (thoracotomy)

In a thoracotomy, the surgeon makes a large cut between the ribs. Where the cut is depends on which part of the lung needs to be removed. In general, the surgeon will spread the ribs to see the lung and nearby organs inside.

Section: Surgery for Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer > Ways to do lung surgery > Video-assisted thoracic surgery (VATS)

Video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS)is a procedure being used more frequently to treat early-stage lung cancers. It uses smaller incisions, typically has a shorter hospital stay and fewer complications than a thoracotomy.
Many experts recommend that only early-stage tumors of the lung be treated this way. The cure rate after this surgery seems to be the same as surgery done with a larger incision. But it’s important that the surgeon doing this procedure is experienced, because it requires a great deal of skill.

Section: Surgery for Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer > Ways to do lung surgery > Robotic-assisted thoracic surgery (RATS)

In this approach, the thoracoscopy is done using a robotic system. The surgeon sits at a control panel in the operating room and moves robotic arms to operate through several small incisions in the patient’s chest.
RATS is similar to VATS in terms of less pain, less blood loss, and shorter recovery time.
For the surgeon, the robotic system may provide more maneuverability and more precision when moving the instruments than standard VATS. Still, the most important factor in the success of either type of thoracoscopic surgery is the surgeon’s experience and skill.

Section: If You Have Small Cell Lung Cancer > What is lung cancer?

Cancer can start any place in the body. Cancer that starts in the lung is called lung cancer. It starts when cells in the lung grow out of control and crowd out normal cells. This makes it hard for the body to work the way it should.
Cancer cells can spread to other parts of the body. For instance, cancer cells in the lung can travel to the bone and grow there. When cancer cells spread, it’s called metastasis.
Cancer is always named for the place where it starts. So when lung cancer spreads to the bone (or any other place), it’s still called lung cancer. It’s not called bone cancer unless it starts in the bone.

Section: If You Have Small Cell Lung Cancer > What is lung cancer? > The lungs

The lungs are 2 sponge-like organs found in the chest. The right lung has 3 parts called lobes. The left lung has 2 lobes. The left lung is smaller because the heart takes up more room on that side of the body. The lungs bring air in and out of the body. They take in oxygen and get rid of carbon dioxide, a waste product.
The windpipe, or trachea, brings air down into the lungs. It splits into 2 tubes called bronchi. (just one tube is called a bronchus).

Section: If You Have Small Cell Lung Cancer > How will the doctor know if I have lung cancer?

---START CHUNK 576---
Symptoms of lung cancer are cough, chest pain, and trouble breathing. The doctor will ask you questions about your health and do a physical exam.
If signs point to lung cancer, more tests will be done. Here are some of the tests you may need:
Chest x-ray: This is often the first test used to look for spots on your lungs. If a change is seen, you will need more tests.
CT scan: This is also called a CAT scan. A CT scan is a special kind of x-ray that takes detailed pictures of your insides. CT scans can also be used to do a biopsy (see below).
PET scan: A type of sugar is put in one of your veins for this test. Then, pictures of your insides are taken with a special camera. If there is cancer, the sugar shows up as “hot spots” where the cancer is found. This test is helpful when your doctor thinks the cancer has spread, but they don’t know where.

---START CHUNK 577---
Biopsy: For a biopsy, the doctor takes out a small piece of the lung tumor. It’s sent to the lab to see if there are cancer cells in it. This is the best way to know for sure if you have cancer.
Bronchoscopy: A thin, lighted, flexible tube is passed through your mouth into the bronchi. The doctor can look through the tube to find tumors. The tube also can be used to take out a piece of the tumor or fluid to see if there are cancer cells.
Blood tests: Blood tests are not used to find lung cancer, but they are done to tell the doctor more about your health.

Section: If You Have Small Cell Lung Cancer > How serious is my cancer?

---START CHUNK 580---
If you have small cell lung cancer, the doctor will want to find out how far it has spread. This is called staging. Knowing the cancer's stage helps your doctor decide what treatment is best for you.
For small cell lung cancer, a 2-stage system is most often used. Small cell lung cancers are staged as limited stage and extensive stage.
- Limited stage means that the cancer is only in one lung and may be in lymph nodes on the same side of the chest.
- Extensive stage means that the cancer has spread to the other lung, to lymph nodes on the other side of the chest, or to distant organs. Many doctors also call cancer that has spread to the fluid around the lung as extensive stage.
If your cancer is limited stage, you might get radiation or chemotherapy (chemo) treatments to try to cure the cancer. An extensive-stage cancer will be treated, but is less likely to be cured. Be sure to ask your doctor about your cancer's stage and what it might mean.

Section: If You Have Small Cell Lung Cancer > What kind of treatment will I need?

There are many ways to treat small cell lung cancer, but the main types of treatment are radiation, chemotherapy, and/or immunotherapy. In rare cases, surgery may be used. Many times, more than one kind of treatment is used.
The treatment plan that’s best for you will depend on:
- The stage of the cancer
- The chance that a type of treatment will cure the cancer or help in some way
- Your age
- Your other health problems
- Your feelings about the treatment and the side effects that may come with it
If you need more information about possible side effects of treatment, see Managing Cancer-related Side Effects.

Section: If You Have Small Cell Lung Cancer > What kind of treatment will I need? > Radiation treatment

Radiation uses high-energy rays (such as x-rays) to kill cancer cells. In limited-stage small cell lung cancer, it’s most often used along with chemo to treat the tumor and lymph nodes in the chest. Or it could be used on the brain to try to keep the cancer from spreading there. Radiation can also be used to relieve symptoms, such as pain, bleeding, trouble swallowing, or other problems. It’s usually given in small doses every day for many weeks.

If your doctor suggests radiation as your treatment, talk to him about what side effects might happen. The most common side effects of radiation are:
- Sunburn-like skin changes where the radiation is given
- Feeling very tired (fatigue)
Most side effects get better after treatment ends. Some might last longer. Talk to your doctor about what you can expect.

Section: If You Have Small Cell Lung Cancer > What kind of treatment will I need? > Chemo

Chemo (the short word for chemotherapy) is the use of drugs to fight cancer. It is most often the main treatment for small cell lung cancer. The drugs may be given through a needle into a vein or taken as pills. These drugs go into the blood and spread through the body.
Chemo is given in cycles or rounds. There’s often a rest period as part of each cycle of treatment. This gives the body time to recover. Treatment often lasts for many months.

Clinical trials are research studies that test new drugs or other treatments in people. They compare standard treatments with others that may be better.
Clinical trials are one way to the newest cancer treatment. They are the best way for doctors to find better ways to treat cancer. If your doctor can find one that’s studying the kind of cancer you have, it’s up to you whether to take part. And if you do sign up for a clinical trial, you can always stop at any time.
If you would like to learn more about clinical trials that might be right for you, start by asking your doctor if your clinic or hospital conducts clinical trials. See Clinical Trials to learn more.

When you have cancer, you might hear about other ways to treat your cancer or treat your symptoms. These may not always be standard medical treatments. These treatments may be vitamins, herbs, diets, and other things. You may wonder about these treatments.
Some of these are known to help, but many have not been tested. Some have been shown not to be helpful. A few have even been found to be harmful. Talk to your doctor about anything you are thinking about using, whether it’s a vitamin, a diet, or anything else.

---START CHUNK 596---
You’ll be glad when treatment is over. But it’s hard not to worry about cancer coming back. Even when cancer never comes back, people still worry about this.
For years after treatment ends, you will still see your doctor. Be sure to go to all of these follow-up visits. You will have exams, blood tests, and maybe other tests to tell if the cancer has come back.
For the first year after treatment, your visits may be every 2 to 3 months. You may have CT scans and blood tests. After the first year or so, your visits might be every 6 months, and then at least once a year after 5 years.
Having cancer and dealing with treatment can be hard, but it can also be a time to look at your life in new ways. You might be thinking about how to improve your health. Call the American Cancer Society at 1-800-227-2345 or talk to your cancer care team to find out what you can do to feel better.

---START CHUNK 597---
You can’t change the fact that you have cancer. What you can change is how you live the rest of your life – making healthy choices and feeling as well as you can.

Section: If You Have Non-small Cell Lung Cancer > What is lung cancer?

Cancer can start any place in the body. Cancer that starts in the lung is called lung cancer. It starts when cells in the lung grow out of control and crowd out normal cells. This makes it hard for the body to work the way it should.
Cancer cells can spread to other parts of the body. For instance, cancer cells in the lung can travel to the bone and grow there. When cancer cells spread, it’s called metastasis.
Cancer is always named for the place where it starts. So when lung cancer spreads to the bone (or any other organ), it’s still called lung cancer. It’s not called bone cancer unless it starts from cells in the bone.
Ask your doctor to show you on this picture where your cancer is found.

Section: If You Have Non-small Cell Lung Cancer > How serious is my cancer?

If you have non-small cell lung cancer, the doctor will want to find out how far it has spread. This is called staging. You may have heard other people say that their cancer was “stage 2” or “stage 3.” Your doctor will want to find out the stage of your cancer to help decide what type of treatment is best for you.
The stage describes if and where the lung cancer has spread. Staging looks for cancer around the lungs in lymph nodes, as well as in organs away from the lungs.
Your stage can be stage 1, 2, 3, or 4. The lower the number, the less the cancer has spread. A higher number, such as stage 4, means that the cancer has spread outside your lungs. Be sure to ask the doctor about your cancer’s stage and what it means.

Section: If You Have Non-small Cell Lung Cancer > What kind of treatment will I need?

There are many ways to treat non-small cell lung cancer.
Surgery and radiation are used to treat only the cancer. They do not affect the rest of the body.
Chemo drugs, targeted therapy, and immunotherapy go through the whole body. They can reach cancer cells almost anywhere in the body.
The treatment for lung cancer can include surgery, radiation, chemotherapy, targeted therapy, and immunotherapy. The treatment plan that’s best for you will depend on:
- The stage of the cancer
- The chance that a type of treatment will cure the cancer or help in some way
- Your age
- Other health problems you have
- Your feelings about the treatment and the side effects that may come with it
If you need more information about possible side effects of treatment, see Managing Cancer-related Side Effects.

Section: If You Have Non-small Cell Lung Cancer > What kind of treatment will I need? > Radiation treatment

Radiation uses high-energy rays (like x-rays) to kill cancer cells. It can be given alone or along with chemo. Radiation can also be used to relieve symptoms such as pain, bleeding, trouble swallowing, or other problems that happen when the lung cancer has grown very large or has spread to other areas like the bones. It’s usually given in small doses every day for many weeks.

If your doctor suggests radiation as your treatment, talk about what side effects might happen. The most common side effects of radiation are:
- Skin changes where the radiation is given
- Feeling very tired (fatigue)
Most side effects get better after treatment ends. Some might last longer. Talk to your cancer care team about what you can expect.

Section: If You Have Non-small Cell Lung Cancer > What kind of treatment will I need? > Chemo

Chemo (the short word for chemotherapy) is the use of drugs to fight cancer. The drugs may be given through a needle into a vein or taken as pills. These drugs go into the blood and spread through the body. Chemo is often given to treat non-small cell lung cancer.
Chemo is given in cycles or rounds. There’s often a rest period as part of each cycle of treatment. This gives the body time to recover. Treatment often lasts for many months.

Chemo can make you feel very tired, sick to your stomach, and cause your hair to fall out. But these problems go away after treatment ends.
There are ways to treat most chemo side effects. If you have side effects, be sure to talk to your cancer care team so they can help.

Section: If You Have Non-small Cell Lung Cancer > What kind of treatment will I need? > Clinical trials

Clinical trials are research studies that test new drugs or other treatments in people. They compare standard treatments with others that may be better.
Clinical trials are one way to get state-of-the art cancer treatment. They are the only way for doctors to find better ways to treat cancer. If your doctor can find one that’s looking at the kind of cancer you have, it’s up to you whether to take part. And if you do sign up for a clinical trial, you can always stop at any time.
If you would like to learn more about clinical trials that might be right for you, start by asking your doctor if your clinic or hospital conducts clinical trials. See Clinical Trials to learn more.

When you have cancer, you might hear about other ways to treat the cancer or treat your symptoms. These may not always be standard medical treatments. These treatments may be vitamins, herbs, special diets, and other things. You may wonder about these treatments.
Some of these are known to help, but many have not been tested. Some have been shown not to help. A few have even been found to be harmful. Talk to your doctor about anything you’re thinking about using, whether it’s a vitamin, a diet, or anything else.

---START CHUNK 636---
You’ll be glad when treatment is over. But it’s hard not to worry about cancer coming back. Even when cancer never comes back, people still worry about it. For years after treatment ends, you will still need to see your doctor. Be sure to go to all of these follow-up visits. You will have exams, blood tests, and maybe other tests to see if the cancer has come back.
For the first 2 to 3 years after treatment, you’ll have doctor visits and CT scans every 3 to 6 months. After that, you will most likely have a doctor visit and CT scan every 6 months.
Having cancer and dealing with treatment can be hard, but it can also be a time to look at your life in new ways. You might be thinking about how to improve your health. Call the American Cancer Society at 1-800-227-2345 or talk to your cancer care team to find out what you can do to feel better.

---START CHUNK 637---
You can’t change the fact that you have cancer. What you can change is how you live the rest of your life – making healthy choices and feeling as well as you can.

Survival rates can give you an idea of what percentage of people with the same type and stage of cancer are still alive a certain amount of time (usually 5 years) after they were diagnosed.

Section: Lung Cancer Survival Rates > How do the numbers apply to you?

Survival rates can’t tell you how long you will live, but they may help give you a better understanding of how likely it is that your treatment will be successful.
Keep in mind that survival rates are estimates and are often based on previous outcomes of large numbers of people who had a specific cancer, but they can’t predict what will happen in any particular person’s case. These statistics can be confusing and may lead you to have more questions. Ask your doctor, who is familiar with your situation, how these numbers may apply to you.

Section: Lung Cancer Survival Rates > What is a 5-year relative survival rate?

A relative survival rate compares people with the same type and stage of cancer to people in the overall population. For example, if the 5-year relative survival rate for a specific stage of lung cancer is 60%, it means that people who have that cancer are, on average, about 60% as likely as people who don’t have that cancer to live for at least 5 years after being diagnosed.

Section: Lung Cancer Survival Rates > Where do these numbers come from?

The American Cancer Society relies on information from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database, maintained by the National Cancer Institute (NCI), to provide survival statistics for different types of cancer.
The SEER database tracks 5-year relative survival rates for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and small cell lung cancer (SCLC) in the United States, based on how far the cancer has spread. The SEER database, however, does not group cancers by AJCC TNM stages (stage 1, stage 2, stage 3, etc.). Instead, it groups cancers into localized, regional, and distant stages:
- Localized: There is no sign that the cancer has spread outside of the lung.
- Regional: The cancer has spread outside the lung to nearby structures or lymph nodes.
- Distant: The cancer has spread to distant parts of the body, such as the brain, bones, liver, or the other lung.

---START CHUNK 657---
- These numbers apply only to the stage of the cancer when it is first diagnosed. They do not apply later on if the cancer grows, spreads, or comes back after treatment.
- These numbers don’t take everything into account. Survival rates are grouped based on how far the cancer has spread. But other factors, such as the subtype of NSCLC, gene changes in the cancer cells, your age and overall health, and how well the cancer responds to treatment, can also affect your outlook.
- People now being diagnosed with NSCLC or SCLC may have a better outlook than these numbers show. Treatments have improved over time, and these numbers are based on people who were diagnosed and treated at least 5 years earlier.

Section: Radiation Therapy for Small Cell Lung Cancer > When is radiation therapy used?

---START CHUNK 672---
Depending on the stage of small cell lung cancer (SCLC) and other factors, radiation therapy might be used:
- To treat the tumor and lymph nodes in the chest. In limited-stage SCLC, it might be used at the same time as chemotherapy (chemo). Giving chemo and radiation together is called concurrent chemoradiation.
- After chemo is finished. This is sometimes done for patients with extensive stage disease, or it can be used for people with limited stage disease who cannot tolerate getting chemotherapy and radiation at the same time.
- To help lower the chances of cancer spreading to the brain. This is called prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI). This is usually given  to people with limited stage SCLC, but it can also help some people with extensive stage SCLC.
- To shrink tumors to relieve (palliate) symptoms of lung cancer such as pain, bleeding, trouble swallowing, cough, shortness of breath, and problems caused by spread to other organs such as the brain or bone.

Section: Radiation Therapy for Small Cell Lung Cancer > Types of radiation therapy

---START CHUNK 674---
The type of radiation therapy most often used to treat SCLC is called external beam radiation therapy (EBRT). A machine outside the body focuses radiation at the cancer.
Treatment is much like getting an x-ray, but the radiation dose is stronger. The procedure itself is painless, and each treatment lasts only a few minutes. Most often, radiation treatments as part of the initial treatment for SCLC is given once or twice daily, 5 days a week, for 3 to 7 weeks. Radiation to relieve symptoms and prophylactic cranial radiation (PCI) is given for shorter periods of time, typically less than 3 weeks.
Newer EBRT techniques have been shown to help doctors treat lung cancers more accurately while lessening the radiation exposure to nearby healthy tissues. These include:

---START CHUNK 675---
Newer EBRT techniques have been shown to help doctors treat lung cancers more accurately while lessening the radiation exposure to nearby healthy tissues. These include:
- Three-dimensional conformal radiation therapy (3D-CRT) uses special computers to precisely map the location of the tumor(s). Radiation beams are shaped and aimed at the tumor(s) from several directions, which makes it less likely to damage normal tissues.
- Intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) is an advanced form of 3D therapy. The beams can be shaped and aimed at the tumor from several angles, and the strength of the beams can be adjusted to limit the dose reaching nearby normal tissues. This technique is used most often if tumors are near important structures such as the spinal cord. A variation of IMRT is called volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT). A machine delivers radiation quickly as it rotates once around the body. This allows each treatment to be given over just a few minutes.

---START CHUNK 676---
- Four-dimensional conformal radiation therapy (4DCT) shows where the tumor is in relation to other structures during each part of the breathing cycle, as opposed to just giving a “snapshot” of a point in time, like a standard CT does. This technique might also be used to help show if a tumor is attached to or invading important structures in the chest, which could help doctors determine if a person might be eligible for surgery.
- Stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT), also known as stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR), is most often used to treat early-stage SCLC when surgery isn’t an option due to a person’s health or in people who don’t want surgery. It might also be considered for tumors that have limited spread to other parts of the body, such as the brain or adrenal glands.

---START CHUNK 677---
Instead of giving a small dose of radiation each day for several weeks, SBRT uses very focused beams of high-dose radiation given in fewer (usually 1 to 5) treatments. Several beams are aimed at the tumor from different angles. To target the radiation precisely, you are put in a specially designed body frame for each treatment. This reduces the movement of the lung tumor during breathing.
- Stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) isn’t really surgery, but a type of stereotactic radiation therapy that is given in only 1 session. It can sometimes be used instead of or along with surgery for single spots tumor.

Section: Radiation Therapy for Small Cell Lung Cancer > Possible side effects of radiation therapy for SCLC

---START CHUNK 679---
If you are going to get radiation therapy, it’s important to ask your doctor beforehand about the possible side effects so that you know what to expect. Common side effects depend on where the radiation therapy is aimed and can include:
- Skin changes in the area being treated, which can range from mild redness to blistering and peeling
- Hair loss (in the area where the radiation enters the body)
- Fatigue (tiredness)
- Nausea and vomiting
- Loss of appetite and weight loss
Most of these side effects go away after treatment, but some can last a long time. When chemotherapy is given with radiation, the side effects may be worse.
Radiation therapy to the chest may damage your lungs, which might cause a cough, problems breathing, and shortness of breath. These usually improve after treatment is over, although sometimes they may not go away completely.

---START CHUNK 680---
Your esophagus, which is in the middle of your chest, may be exposed to radiation, which could cause a sore throat and trouble swallowing during or shortly after treatment. This might make it hard to eat anything other than soft foods or liquids for a while. This also often improves after treatment is finished.
Radiation therapy to large areas of the brain can sometimes cause memory loss, fatigue, headaches, or trouble thinking. Usually these symptoms are minor compared with those caused by cancer that has spread to the brain, but they can affect your quality of life.

NSCLC is any type of epithelial lung cancer other than small cell lung cancer (SCLC). The most common types of NSCLC are squamous cell carcinoma, large cell carcinoma, and adenocarcinoma, but there are several other types that occur less frequently, and all types can occur in unusual histological variants. Although NSCLCs are associated with cigarette smoke, adenocarcinomas may be found in patients who never smoked.

---START CHUNK 696---
As a class, NSCLC is usually less sensitive to chemotherapy and radiation therapy than SCLC. Patients with resectable disease may be cured by surgery or surgery followed by chemotherapy. Local control can be achieved with radiation therapy in many patients with unresectable disease, but cure is seen in relatively few patients. Patients with locally advanced unresectable disease may achieve long-term survival with radiation therapy combined with chemotherapy. Patients with advanced metastatic disease may achieve improved survival and palliation of symptoms with chemotherapy, targeted agents, and other supportive measures.

Estimated new cases and deaths from lung cancer (NSCLC and SCLC combined) in the United States in 2024:[1]
- New cases: 234,580.
- Deaths: 125,070.
Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related mortality in the United States. The 5-year relative survival rate from 2013 to 2019 for patients with lung cancer was 25%. The 5-year relative survival rate varies markedly for patients diagnosed at local stage (63%), regional stage (35%), or distant stage (8%).[1]

Section: Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Treatment (PDQ®)–Health Professional Version > General Information About Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) > Anatomy

NSCLC arises from the epithelial cells of the lung of the central bronchi to terminal alveoli. The histological type of NSCLC correlates with site of origin, reflecting the variation in respiratory tract epithelium of the bronchi to alveoli. Squamous cell carcinoma usually starts near a central bronchus. Adenocarcinoma and bronchioloalveolar carcinoma usually originate in peripheral lung tissue.

Smoking-related lung carcinogenesis is a multistep process. Squamous cell carcinoma and adenocarcinoma have defined premalignant precursor lesions. Before becoming invasive, lung epithelium may undergo morphological changes that include:
- Hyperplasia.
- Metaplasia.
- Dysplasia.
- Carcinoma in situ.
Dysplasia and carcinoma in situ are considered the principal premalignant lesions because they are more likely to progress to invasive cancer and less likely to spontaneously regress.

---START CHUNK 702---
Increasing age is the most important risk factor for most cancers. Other risk factors for lung cancer include the following:
- History of or current tobacco use: cigarettes, pipes, and cigars.[2]
- Exposure to cancer-causing substances in secondhand smoke.[3,4]
- Occupational exposure to asbestos, arsenic, chromium, beryllium, nickel, and other agents.[5]
- Radiation exposure from any of the following:
Radiation therapy to the breast or chest.[6]
Radon exposure in the home or workplace.[7]
Medical imaging tests, such as computed tomography (CT) scans.[8]
Atomic bomb radiation.[9]
- Radiation therapy to the breast or chest.[6]
- Radon exposure in the home or workplace.[7]
- Medical imaging tests, such as computed tomography (CT) scans.[8]
- Atomic bomb radiation.[9]
- Living in an area with air pollution.[10-12]
- Family history of lung cancer.[13]
- Human immunodeficiency virus infection.[14]
- Beta carotene supplements in heavy smokers.[15,16]

---START CHUNK 703---
- Living in an area with air pollution.[10-12]
- Family history of lung cancer.[13]
- Human immunodeficiency virus infection.[14]
- Beta carotene supplements in heavy smokers.[15,16]
The single most important risk factor for the development of lung cancer is smoking. For a smoker, the risk of lung cancer is, on average, tenfold higher than in a lifetime nonsmoker (defined as a person who has smoked <100 cigarettes in his or her lifetime). The risk increases with the quantity of cigarettes, duration of smoking, and starting age.
Smoking cessation results in a decrease in precancerous lesions and a reduction in lung cancer risk. Former smokers continue to have an elevated risk of lung cancer for years after quitting. Asbestos exposure may exert a synergistic effect of cigarette smoking on lung cancer risk.[17]
In addition, after resection of a lung cancer, there is a 1% to 2% risk per patient per year that a second lung cancer will occur.[18]

---START CHUNK 704---
In addition, after resection of a lung cancer, there is a 1% to 2% risk per patient per year that a second lung cancer will occur.[18]
A significant number of patients cured of their smoking-related lung cancer may develop a second malignancy. In the Lung Cancer Study Group trial of 907 patients with stage T1, N0 resected tumors, the rate was 1.8% per year for nonpulmonary second cancers and 1.6% per year for new lung cancers.[19] Other studies have reported even higher risks of second tumors in long-term survivors, including rates of 10% for second lung cancers and 20% for all second cancers.[20]

---START CHUNK 705---
Because of the persistent risk of developing second lung cancers in former smokers, various chemoprevention strategies have been evaluated in randomized control trials. None of the phase III trials using the agents beta carotene, retinol, 13-cis-retinoic acid, [alpha]-tocopherol, N-acetylcysteine, or acetylsalicylic acid has demonstrated beneficial, reproducible results.[16,21-24][Level of evidence A1] Chemoprevention of second primary cancers of the upper aerodigestive tract is undergoing clinical evaluation in patients with early-stage lung cancer.

In patients considered at high risk of developing lung cancer, the only screening modality for early detection that has been shown to alter mortality is low-dose helical CT scanning.[25] Studies have failed to demonstrate that screening with chest radiography and sputum cytology lowers lung cancer mortality rates.
For more information, see the Screening by low-dose computed tomography: benefit section in Lung Cancer Screening.

---START CHUNK 708---
Lung cancer may present with symptoms or be found incidentally on chest imaging. The most common symptoms at presentation include:
- Worsening cough.
- Chest pain.
- Hemoptysis.
- Malaise.
- Weight loss.
- Dyspnea.
- Hoarseness.
Symptoms may result from local invasion or compression of adjacent thoracic structures, such as compression involving the esophagus causing dysphagia, compression involving the laryngeal nerves causing hoarseness, or compression involving the superior vena cava causing facial edema and distension of the superficial veins of the head and neck.
Symptoms from distant metastases may also be present and include neurological defect or personality change from brain metastases or pain from bone metastases. Infrequently, patients may present with symptoms and signs of paraneoplastic diseases such as hypertrophic osteoarthropathy with digital clubbing or hypercalcemia from parathyroid hormone-related protein.

---START CHUNK 711---
Investigations of patients with suspected NSCLC focus on confirming the diagnosis and determining the extent of the disease. Treatment options are determined by histology, stage, and general health and comorbidities of the patient.
The procedures used to determine the presence of cancer include:
- History.
- Physical examination.
- Routine laboratory evaluations.
- Chest x-ray.
- Chest CT scan with infusion of contrast material.
- Biopsy.
Before a patient begins lung cancer treatment, an experienced lung cancer pathologist must review the pathological material. This is critical because SCLC, which responds well to chemotherapy and is generally not treated surgically, can be confused on microscopic examination with NSCLC.[26] Immunohistochemistry and electron microscopy are invaluable techniques for diagnosis and subclassification, but most lung tumors can be classified by light microscopic criteria.

---START CHUNK 714---
Multiple studies have attempted to identify the prognostic importance of a variety of clinicopathological factors.[20,27-30] Factors that have correlated with adverse prognosis include:
- Increasing stage.
- Presence of pulmonary or constitutional symptoms.
- Large tumor size (>3 cm).
- Metastases to multiple lymph nodes within a TNM-defined nodal station.[31-41] For more information, see the Evaluation of mediastinal lymph node metastasis section.
- Vascular invasion.[28,42-44]
For patients with inoperable disease, prognosis is adversely affected by poor performance status and weight loss of more than 10%. These patients have been excluded from clinical trials evaluating aggressive multimodality interventions.
In multiple retrospective analyses of clinical trial data, advanced age alone has not been shown to influence response or survival with therapy.[45]

In multiple retrospective analyses of clinical trial data, advanced age alone has not been shown to influence response or survival with therapy.[45]
Because treatment is not satisfactory for almost all patients with NSCLC, eligible patients should consider clinical trials. Information about ongoing clinical trials is available from the NCI website.

Malignant non-small cell epithelial tumors of the lung are classified by the World Health Organization (WHO)/International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer (IASLC). The three main subtypes of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) include:
- Squamous cell carcinoma (25% of lung cancers).
- Adenocarcinoma (40% of lung cancers).
- Large cell carcinoma (10% of lung cancers).
Additional types include adenosquamous carcinoma, sarcomatoid carcinomas, salivary gland type tumors, carcinoid tumors, and other unclassified carcinomas. There are many subtypes in these categories.[1]

Most squamous cell carcinomas of the lung are located centrally, in the larger bronchi of the lung. Squamous cell carcinomas are linked more strongly with smoking than other forms of NSCLC. The incidence of squamous cell carcinoma of the lung has been decreasing in recent years.

---START CHUNK 733---
Adenocarcinoma is now the most common histological subtype in many countries, and subclassification of adenocarcinoma is important. One of the biggest problems with lung adenocarcinomas is the frequent histological heterogeneity. Mixtures of adenocarcinoma histological subtypes are more common than tumors consisting purely of a single pattern of acinar, papillary, bronchioloalveolar, and solid adenocarcinoma with mucin formation.
Criteria for the diagnosis of bronchioloalveolar carcinoma have varied widely in the past. The current WHO/IASLC definition is much more restrictive than that previously used by many pathologists because it is limited to only noninvasive tumors.

---START CHUNK 734---
If stromal, vascular, or pleural invasion are identified in an adenocarcinoma that has an extensive bronchioloalveolar carcinoma component, the classification would be an adenocarcinoma of mixed subtype with predominant bronchioloalveolar pattern and a focal acinar, solid, or papillary pattern, depending on which pattern is seen in the invasive component. However, the future of bronchioloalveolar carcinoma as a distinct clinical entity is unclear; a multidisciplinary expert panel representing the IASLC, the American Thoracic Society, and the European Respiratory Society proposed a major revision of the classification of adenocarcinomas in 2011 that entails a reclassification of what was called bronchioloalveolar carcinoma into newly defined histological subgroups.
The following variants of adenocarcinoma are recognized in the WHO/IASLC classification:
- Well-differentiated fetal adenocarcinoma.
- Mucinous (colloid) adenocarcinoma.
- Mucinous cystadenocarcinoma.

---START CHUNK 735---
- Well-differentiated fetal adenocarcinoma.

In addition to the general category of large cell carcinoma, several uncommon variants are recognized in the WHO/IASLC classification, including:
- Large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma (LCNEC).
- Basaloid carcinoma.
- Lymphoepithelioma-like carcinoma.
- Clear cell carcinoma.
- Large cell carcinoma with rhabdoid phenotype.
Basaloid carcinoma is also recognized as a variant of squamous cell carcinoma, and rarely, adenocarcinomas may have a basaloid pattern; however, in tumors without either of these features, they are regarded as a variant of large cell carcinoma.

Section: Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Treatment (PDQ®)–Health Professional Version > Cellular and Molecular Classification of NSCLC > Tumor Types > Neuroendocrine tumors

LCNEC is recognized as a histologically high-grade non-small cell carcinoma. It has a very poor prognosis similar to that of small cell lung cancer (SCLC). Atypical carcinoid is recognized as an intermediate-grade neuroendocrine tumor with a prognosis that falls between typical carcinoid and high-grade SCLC and LCNEC.
Neuroendocrine differentiation can be demonstrated by immunohistochemistry or electron microscopy in 10% to 20% of common NSCLCs that do not have any neuroendocrine morphology. These tumors are not formally recognized within the WHO/IASLC classification scheme because the clinical and therapeutic significance of neuroendocrine differentiation in NSCLC is not firmly established. These tumors are referred to collectively as NSCLC with neuroendocrine differentiation.

This is a group of rare tumors. Spindle cell carcinomas and giant cell carcinomas comprise only 0.4% of all lung malignancies, and carcinosarcomas comprise only 0.1% of all lung malignancies. In addition, this group of tumors reflects a continuum in histological heterogeneity, as well as epithelial and mesenchymal differentiation. On the basis of clinical and molecular data, biphasic pulmonary blastoma is regarded as part of the spectrum of carcinomas with pleomorphic, sarcomatoid, or sarcomatous elements.

The identification of mutations in lung cancer has led to the development of molecularly targeted therapy to improve the survival of subsets of patients with metastatic disease.[2] In particular, subsets of adenocarcinoma now can be defined by specific mutations in genes encoding components of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and downstream mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinases (PI3K) signaling pathways. These mutations may define mechanisms of drug sensitivity and primary or acquired resistance to kinase inhibitors. Genomic alterations that can be targeted with approved therapies or for which treatments are under development include:
- EGFR.
- ALK.
- BRAF.
- ROS1.
- RET.
- NTRK1, NTRK2, and NTRK3.
- MET.
- KRAS.
- HER2.

- EGFR.
- ALK.
- BRAF.
- ROS1.
- RET.
- NTRK1, NTRK2, and NTRK3.
- MET.
- KRAS.
- HER2.
EGFR and ALK mutations predominate in adenocarcinomas that develop in nonsmokers, and KRAS and BRAF mutations are more common in smokers or former smokers. EGFR mutations strongly predict the improved response rate and progression-free survival of patients who take EGFR inhibitors. In a set of 2,142 lung adenocarcinoma specimens from patients treated at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, EGFR exon 19 deletions and L858R were found in 15% of tumors from former smokers (181 of 1,218; 95% confidence interval [CI], 13%–17%), 6% from current smokers (20 of 344; 95% CI, 4%–9%), and 52% from never-smokers (302 of 580; 95% CI, 48%–56%; P < .001 for ever- vs. never-smokers).[3]

---START CHUNK 743---
Fusions of ALK with EML4 genes form translocation products that occur in ranges from 3% to 7% in unselected NSCLC and are responsive to pharmacological inhibition of ALK by agents such as crizotinib. Sensitizing fusions of ALK with other genes have also been reported.

---START CHUNK 747---
In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), the determination of stage has important therapeutic and prognostic implications. Careful initial diagnostic evaluation to define the location and to determine the extent of primary and metastatic tumor involvement is critical for the appropriate care of patients.
In general, symptoms, physical signs, laboratory findings, and perceived risk of distant metastasis lead to an evaluation for distant metastatic disease. Additional tests such as bone scans and computed tomography (CT)/magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain may be performed if initial assessments suggest metastases or if patients with stage III disease are being evaluated for aggressive local and combined modality treatments.

---START CHUNK 748---
Stage has a critical role in the selection of therapy. The stage of disease is based on a combination of clinical factors and pathological factors.[1] The distinction between clinical stage and pathological stage should be considered when evaluating reports of survival outcome.
Procedures used to determine stage include:
- History.
- Physical examination.
- Routine laboratory evaluations.
- Chest x-ray.
- Chest CT scan with infusion of contrast material.
- Fluorine F 18-fludeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (18F-FDG PET) scanning.
Procedures used to obtain tissue samples include bronchoscopy, mediastinoscopy, or anterior mediastinotomy.
Pathological staging of NSCLC requires examination of the tumor, knowledge of resection margins, and determination of lymph node status.
At diagnosis, patients with NSCLC can be divided into the following three groups that reflect both the extent of the disease and the treatment approach:

---START CHUNK 753---
Surgical staging of the mediastinum is considered standard if accurate evaluation of the nodal status is needed to determine therapy.
Accurate staging of the mediastinal lymph nodes provides important prognostic information.
Evidence (nodal status):
- The association between survival and the number of examined lymph nodes during surgery for patients with stage I NSCLC treated with definitive surgical resection was assessed from the population-based Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program database for the period from 1990 to 2000.[2] A total of 16,800 patients were included in the study.
The overall survival analysis for patients without radiation therapy was done by comparing the reference group (one to four lymph nodes) with the following groups:
Patients with five to eight lymph nodes examined during surgery had a modest but statistically significant increase in survival, with a proportionate hazard ratio (HR) of 0.90 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.84–0.97).

---START CHUNK 754---
For patients with 9 to 12 examined lymph nodes, the HR was 0.86 (95% CI, 0.79–0.95).
For patients with 13 to 16 examined lymph nodes, the HR was 0.78 (95% CI, 0.68–0.90).
There appeared to be no incremental improvement after evaluating more than 16 lymph nodes.
The corresponding results for lung cancer–specific mortality and for patients who received radiation therapy were not substantially different.
These results indicate that patient survival following resection for NSCLC is associated with the number of lymph nodes evaluated during surgery. Because this is most likely the result of a reduction-of-staging error, namely, a decreased likelihood of missing positive lymph nodes with an increasing number of lymph nodes sampled, it suggests that an evaluation of nodal status should include 11 to 16 lymph nodes.

---START CHUNK 759---
CT scanning is primarily used for determining the size of the tumor. The CT scan should extend inferiorly to include the liver and adrenal glands. MRI scans of the thorax and upper abdomen do not appear to yield advantages over CT scans.[3]
Evidence (CT scan):
- A systematic review of the medical literature relating to the accuracy of CT scanning for noninvasive staging of the mediastinum in patients with lung cancer was conducted. In the 35 studies published between 1991 and June 2006, 5,111 evaluable patients were identified. Almost all studies specified that CT scanning was performed following the administration of intravenous contrast material and that a positive test result was defined as the presence of one or more lymph nodes that measured larger than 1 cm on the short-axis diameter.[4]
The median prevalence of mediastinal metastasis was 28% (range, 18%–56%).

---START CHUNK 763---
The wider availability and use of 18F-FDG PET scanning for staging has modified the approach to staging mediastinal lymph nodes and distant metastases.
Randomized trials evaluating the utility of 18F-FDG PET scanning in potentially resectable NSCLC patients reported conflicting results in terms of the relative reduction in the number of noncurative thoracotomies.
Although the current evidence is conflicting, 18F-FDG PET scanning may improve results of early-stage lung cancer by identifying patients who have evidence of metastatic disease that is beyond the scope of surgical resection and that is not evident by standard preoperative staging procedures.
Evidence (18F-FDG PET scan):

---START CHUNK 764---
Evidence (18F-FDG PET scan):
- A systematic review, an expansion of a health technology assessment conducted in 2001 by the Institute for Clinical and Evaluative Sciences, evaluated the accuracy and utility of 18F-FDG PET scanning in the diagnosis and staging of lung cancer.[7] Through a systematic search of the literature, 12 evidence summary reports and 15 prospective studies of the diagnostic accuracy of 18F-FDG PET scanning were identified.
18F-FDG PET scanning appears to be superior to CT imaging for mediastinal staging in NSCLC.
18F-FDG PET scanning also appears to have high sensitivity and reasonable specificity for differentiating benign from malignant lesions as small as 1 cm.

- A systematic review of the medical literature relating to the accuracy of 18F-FDG PET scanning for noninvasive staging of the mediastinum in patients with lung cancer identified 44 studies published between 1994 and 2006 with 2,865 evaluable patients.[4]
The median prevalence of mediastinal metastases was 29% (range, 5%–64%).
Pooled estimates of sensitivity and specificity for identifying mediastinal metastasis were 74% (95% CI, 69%–79%) for sensitivity and 85% (95% CI, 82%–88%) for specificity.
Corresponding positive (4.9%) and negative (0.3%) likelihood ratios were provided for mediastinal staging with 18F-FDG PET scanning.
These findings demonstrated that 18F-FDG PET scanning is more accurate than CT scanning for staging of the mediastinum in patients with lung cancer.

Decision analyses demonstrate that 18F-FDG PET scanning may reduce the overall costs of medical care by identifying patients with falsely negative CT scans in the mediastinum or otherwise undetected sites of metastases.[8-10] Studies concluded that the money saved by forgoing mediastinoscopy in 18F-FDG PET-positive mediastinal lesions was not justified because of the unacceptably high number of false-positive results.[8-10] A randomized study found that the addition of 18F-FDG PET scanning to conventional staging was associated with significantly fewer thoracotomies.[11] A second randomized trial evaluating the impact of 18F-FDG PET scanning on clinical management found that 18F-FDG PET scanning provided additional information regarding appropriate stage but did not lead to significantly fewer thoracotomies.[12]

---START CHUNK 769---
The combination of CT imaging and 18F-FDG PET scanning has greater sensitivity and specificity than CT imaging alone.[13]
Evidence (CT/18F-FDG PET scan):
- If there is no evidence of distant metastatic disease on CT scan, 18F-FDG PET scanning complements CT scan staging of the mediastinum. Numerous nonrandomized studies of 18F-FDG PET scanning have evaluated mediastinal lymph nodes using surgery (i.e., mediastinoscopy and/or thoracotomy with mediastinal lymph node dissection) as the gold standard of comparison.
- A meta-analysis evaluated the conditional test performance of 18F-FDG PET scanning and CT scanning.
The median sensitivity and specificity of 18F-FDG PET scans were reported as 100% for sensitivity and 78% for specificity in patients with enlarged lymph nodes.[5]

The median sensitivity and specificity of 18F-FDG PET scans were reported as 100% for sensitivity and 78% for specificity in patients with enlarged lymph nodes.[5]
18F-FDG PET scanning is considered very accurate in identifying malignant nodal involvement when lymph nodes are enlarged. However, 18F-FDG PET scanning will falsely identify a malignancy in approximately one-fourth of patients with lymph nodes that are enlarged for other reasons, usually as a result of inflammation or infection.[14,15]

- The median sensitivity and specificity of 18F-FDG PET scanning in patients with normal-sized mediastinal lymph nodes were 82% for sensitivity and 93% for specificity.[5] These data indicate that nearly 20% of patients with normal-sized lymph nodes but with malignant involvement had falsely negative 18F-FDG PET scan findings.

---START CHUNK 772---
For patients with clinically operable NSCLC, the evidence supports performing a biopsy of mediastinal lymph nodes that are found to be larger than 1 cm in shortest transverse axis on chest CT scan or are found to be positive on 18F-FDG PET scan. Negative 18F-FDG PET scanning does not preclude biopsy of radiographically enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes. Mediastinoscopy is necessary for the detection of cancer in mediastinal lymph nodes when the results of the CT scan and 18F-FDG PET scan do not corroborate each other.

Patients at risk of brain metastases may be staged with CT or MRI scans.
Evidence (staging with CT or MRI):
- One study randomly assigned 332 patients with potentially operable NSCLC and no neurological symptoms to brain CT or MRI imaging to detect occult brain metastasis before lung surgery.[16]
MRI showed a trend towards a higher preoperative detection rate than CT scan (P = .069), with an overall detection rate of approximately 7% from pretreatment to 12 months after surgery.
Patients with stage I or stage II disease had a detection rate of 4% (i.e., 8 detections out of 200 patients); however, individuals with stage III disease had a detection rate of 11.4% (i.e., 15 detections out of 132 patients).
The mean maximal diameter of the brain metastases was significantly smaller in the MRI group.

Numerous nonrandomized, prospective, and retrospective studies have demonstrated that 18F-FDG PET scanning offers diagnostic advantages over conventional imaging in staging distant metastatic disease; however, standard 18F-FDG PET scans have limitations. 18F-FDG PET scans may not extend below the pelvis and may not detect bone metastases in the long bones of the lower extremities. Because the metabolic tracer used in 18F-FDG PET scanning accumulates in the brain and urinary tract, 18F-FDG PET scanning is not reliable for detection of metastases in these sites.[16]

- Current Clinical Trials
In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), results of standard treatment are poor except for the most localized cancers. All newly diagnosed patients with NSCLC are potential candidates for studies evaluating new forms of treatment.
Treatment decisions are based on some of the following factors:
- Knowledge of histological type and molecular features.
- Tumor size and location.
- Involvement of pleura.
- Surgical margins.
- Status and location of lymph nodes by station.
- Tumor grade.
- Lymphovascular invasion.

---START CHUNK 788---

- Lymphovascular invasion.
Surgery is potentially the most curative therapeutic option for this disease. Postoperative chemotherapy may provide an additional benefit to patients with resected NSCLC. Radiation therapy combined with chemotherapy can produce a cure in a small number of patients and can provide palliation in most patients. Prophylactic cranial irradiation may reduce the incidence of brain metastases, but there is no evidence of a survival benefit and the effect of prophylactic cranial irradiation on quality of life is not known.[1,2] In patients with advanced-stage disease, chemotherapy or epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) kinase inhibitors offer modest improvements in median survival, although overall survival is poor.[3,4]

---START CHUNK 789---
Chemotherapy has produced short-term improvement in disease-related symptoms in patients with advanced NSCLC. Several clinical trials have attempted to assess the impact of chemotherapy on tumor-related symptoms and quality of life. In total, these studies suggest that tumor-related symptoms may be controlled by chemotherapy without adversely affecting overall quality of life;[5,6] however, the impact of chemotherapy on quality of life requires more study. In general, medically eligible older patients with good performance status obtain the same benefits from treatment as younger patients.

---START CHUNK 790---
The identification of gene mutations in lung cancer has led to the development of molecularly targeted therapy to improve the survival of subsets of patients with metastatic disease.[7] In particular, genetic abnormalities in EGFR, MAPK, and PI3K signaling pathways in subsets of NSCLC may define mechanisms of drug sensitivity and primary or acquired resistance to kinase inhibitors. EGFR mutations strongly predict the improved response rate and progression-free survival of inhibitors of EGFR. Fusions of ALK with EML4 and other genes form translocation products that occur in ranges from 3% to 7% in unselected NSCLC and are responsive to pharmacological inhibition of ALK by agents such as alectinib. The MET oncogene encodes hepatocyte growth factor receptor. Amplification of this gene has been associated with secondary resistance to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Recurrent fusions involving the ROS1 gene are observed in up to 2% of NSCLCs and are responsive to treatment with crizotinib

---START CHUNK 791---
associated with secondary resistance to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Recurrent fusions involving the ROS1 gene are observed in up to 2% of NSCLCs and are responsive to treatment with crizotinib and entrectinib. NTRK gene fusions can occur in up to 1% of NSCLCs and can be treated with the TRK inhibitors, larotrectinib and entrectinib. For more information, see the Molecular Features section.

---START CHUNK 792---
The treatment options for each stage of NSCLC are presented in Table 5.
In addition to the treatment options presented in Table 5, treatment options under clinical evaluation include:
- Combining local treatment (surgery).
- Regional treatment (radiation therapy).
- Systemic treatments (chemotherapy, immunotherapy, and targeted agents).
- Developing more effective systemic therapy.

- Treatment Options for Occult NSCLC
- Current Clinical Trials
In occult lung cancer, a diagnostic evaluation often includes chest x-ray and selective bronchoscopy with close follow-up (e.g., computed tomography scan), when needed, to define the site and nature of the primary tumor; tumors discovered in this fashion are generally early stage and curable by surgery.
After discovery of the primary tumor, treatment involves establishing the stage of the tumor. Therapy is identical to that recommended for other non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients with similar-stage disease.

Segmentectomy or wedge resection are used to preserve maximum normal pulmonary tissue because patients with stage 0 NSCLC are at a high risk of second lung cancers. Because these tumors are by definition noninvasive and incapable of metastasizing, they should be curable with surgical resection; however, such lesions, when identified, are often centrally located and may require a lobectomy.

Patients with central lesions may be candidates for curative endobronchial therapy. Endobronchial therapies that preserve lung function include photodynamic therapy, electrocautery, cryotherapy, and Nd-YAG laser therapy.[3-6]
Evidence (endobronchial therapies):
- Small case series have reported high complete response rates and long-term survival in selected patients.[7,8][Level of evidence C2]
Efficacy of these treatment modalities in the management of patients with early NSCLC remains to be proven in definitive randomized controlled trials.
A high incidence of second primary cancers develop in these patients.[1,2]

---START CHUNK 813---
Surgery is the treatment of choice for patients with stage I NSCLC. A lobectomy or segmental, wedge, or sleeve resection may be performed as appropriate. Patients with impaired pulmonary function are candidates for segmental or wedge resection of the primary tumor. Careful preoperative assessment of the patient’s overall medical condition, especially the patient’s pulmonary reserve, is critical in considering the benefits of surgery. The immediate postoperative mortality rate is age related, but a 3% to 5% mortality rate with lobectomy can be expected.[1]
Evidence (surgery):
- The Lung Cancer Study Group conducted a randomized study (LCSG-821) that compared lobectomy with limited resection for patients with stage I lung cancer. Results of the study showed:[2]
A reduction in local recurrence for patients treated with lobectomy compared with those treated with limited excision.
No significant difference in overall survival (OS).

- The rate of locoregional recurrence was significantly less after lobectomy, regardless of primary tumor size.

Those treated with wedge or segmental resections had a local recurrence rate of 50% (i.e., 31 recurrences out of 62 patients) despite having undergone complete resections.[4]
- Those treated with wedge or segmental resections had a local recurrence rate of 50% (i.e., 31 recurrences out of 62 patients) despite having undergone complete resections.[4]
- A multicenter, noninferiority, phase III trial (NCT00499330) evaluated lobar or sublobar resection in patients with peripheral stage IA NSCLC. A total of 697 patients with clinical stage T1a, N0 tumors (tumor size <2 cm) were randomly assigned to undergo sublobar resection or lobar resection after intraoperative confirmation of node-negative disease in the hilar and mediastinal lymph nodes. The primary end point was disease-free survival (DFS).[5][Level of evidence B1]

---START CHUNK 816---
After a median follow-up of 7 years, sublobar resection was noninferior to lobar resection for DFS (hazard ratio [HR], 1.01; 90% confidence interval [CI], 0.83–1.24; one-sided P = .02 for noninferiority).
OS was similar after sublobar resection or lobar resection (HR, 0.95; 95% CI, 0.72–1.26).
No substantial differences were noted in the incidence of locoregional or distant disease recurrence between the two groups.
At 6 months after surgery, the magnitude of reduction from baseline in the percentage of predicted FEV1 (forced expiratory volume in first second of expiration) was greater in the lobectomy group (-6%; 95% CI, -8% to -5%) versus the sublobar resection group (-4%; 95% CI, -5% to -2%). The magnitude of reduction in the percentage of predicted FVC (forced vital capacity) was also greater after lobectomy (-5%; 95% CI, -7% to -3%) than after sublobar resection (-3%; 95% CI, -4% to -1%).

- The Cochrane Collaboration reviewed 11 randomized trials with a total of 1,910 patients who underwent surgical interventions for early-stage (I–IIIA) lung cancer.[6] A pooled analysis of three trials reported the following:
Four-year survival was superior in patients with resectable stage I, II, or IIIA NSCLC who underwent resection and complete ipsilateral mediastinal lymph node dissection (CMLND), compared with those who underwent resection and lymph node sampling; the HR was estimated to be 0.78 (95% CI, 0.65–0.93, P = .005).[6][Level of evidence A1]
There was a significant reduction in any cancer recurrence (local or distant) in the CMLND group (relative risk [RR], 0.79; 95% CI, 0.66–0.95; P = .01) that appeared mainly because of a reduction in the number of distant recurrences (RR, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.61–1.00; P = .05).

Many patients who have surgery subsequently develop regional or distant metastases.[9] Such patients are candidates for entry into clinical trials evaluating postoperative treatment with chemotherapy or radiation therapy following surgery. At present, neither chemotherapy nor radiation therapy has been found to improve survival in patients with stage I NSCLC that has been completely resected.

Based on a meta-analysis, postoperative chemotherapy is not recommended outside of a clinical trial for patients with completely resected stage I NSCLC.[10] However, there may be some benefit of adjuvant chemotherapy in patients with stage IB tumors that are larger than 4 cm.
Evidence (adjuvant chemotherapy for patients with stage IB NSCLC):
- The Cancer and Leukemia Group B study (CALGB-9633 [NCT00002852]) addressed the results of adjuvant carboplatin and paclitaxel versus observation for OS in 344 patients with resected stage IB (i.e., pathological T2, N0) NSCLC. Within 4 to 8 weeks of resection, patients were randomly assigned to postoperative chemotherapy or observation.[11]
Survival was not significantly different (HR, 0.83; 90% CI, 0.64–1.08; P = .12) at a median follow-up of 74 months.
Grades 3 to 4 neutropenia were the predominant toxicity; there were no treatment-related deaths.

Grades 3 to 4 neutropenia were the predominant toxicity; there were no treatment-related deaths.

Given the magnitude of observed survival differences, CALGB-9633 may have been underpowered to detect small but clinically meaningful improvements in survival. In addition, the use of a carboplatin versus a cisplatin combination might have affected the results. At present, there is no reliable evidence that postoperative chemotherapy improves survival of patients with stage IB NSCLC.[11][Level of evidence A1]

Adjuvant targeted therapy with osimertinib for patients with EGFR-mutated NSCLC and resected stage IB to IIIA NSCLC was studied in a phase III clinical trial and showed improved OS.
Evidence (adjuvant targeted therapy with osimertinib for patients with stage IB EGFR-mutated NSCLC):
- The ADAURA (NCT02511106) phase III, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial randomly assigned 682 patients with surgically resected stage IB to stage IIIA NSCLC with EGFR-sensitizing mutations (centrally determined, deletion in exon 19 or L858R mutation in exon 21) to receive either osimertinib 80 mg by mouth daily or a placebo for 3 years. Standard postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy was allowed but not mandatory; decisions regarding adjuvant chemotherapy were made by the physician and patient before trial enrollment. There were 399 patients who received osimertinib and 342 patients who received placebo.[12][Level of evidence A1]

---START CHUNK 830---
In the overall population, the 5-year OS rate was 88% in the osimertinib group and 78% in the placebo group (overall HRdeath, 0.49; 95.03% CI, 0.34–0.70; P < .001).
Among patients with stage II to IIIA disease, the 5-year OS rate was 85% in the osimertinib group and 73% in the placebo group (overall HRdeath, 0.49; 95.03% CI, 0.33–0.73; P < .001).
The adverse event profile is consistent with other studies that used osimertinib except for pneumonia related to COVID-19, which was reported later.

The FDA approved pembrolizumab as a single agent for adjuvant treatment following resection and platinum-based chemotherapy for patients with stage IB (T2a ≥4 cm), II, or IIIA NSCLC. Of note, the FDA label specifies that pembrolizumab can be used as adjuvant therapy after platinum-based chemotherapy. However, chemotherapy was not required in the overall study patient population evaluated in KEYNOTE-091.

A substantial number of patients are ineligible for standard surgical resection because of comorbid conditions that are associated with unacceptably high perioperative risk. Patients with potentially resectable tumors with medical contraindications to surgery or those with inoperable stage I disease and with sufficient pulmonary reserve may be candidates for radiation therapy with curative intent.[16-18] Nonrandomized observational studies comparing treatment outcomes associated with resection, radiation therapy, and observation have demonstrated shorter survival times and higher mortality for patients who undergo observation only.[16,19]

---START CHUNK 842---
Historically, conventional primary radiation therapy consisted of approximately 60 Gy to 70 Gy delivered with megavoltage equipment to the midplane of the known tumor volume using conventional fractionation (1.8–2.0 Gy per day).
Improvements in radiation techniques include planning techniques to account for tumor motion, more conformal planning techniques (e.g., 3-D conformal radiation therapy and intensity-modulated radiation therapy), and image guidance during treatment. Modern approaches to delivery of external-beam radiation therapy (EBRT) include hypofractionated radiation therapy and stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT). However, there are limited reliable data from comparative trials to determine which approaches yield superior outcomes.[17,18]

However, local-only failure occurs in as many as 50% of patients treated with conventional radiation therapy to doses in the range of 60 Gy to 65 Gy.[24,25]

---START CHUNK 847---
Hypofractionated radiation therapy involves the delivery of a slightly higher dose of radiation therapy per day (e.g., 2.4–4.0 Gy) over a shorter period of time compared with conventionally fractionated radiation therapy. Multiple prospective phase I/II trials have demonstrated that hypofractionated radiation therapy to a dose of 60 Gy to 70 Gy delivered over 3 to 4 weeks with 2.4 Gy to 4.0 Gy per day resulted in a low incidence of moderate to severe toxicity, 2-year OS rates of 50% to 60%, and 2-year tumor local control of 80% to 90%.[26-28][Level of evidence C1]

---START CHUNK 849---
SBRT involves the delivery of highly conformal, high-dose radiation therapy over an extremely hypofractionated course (e.g., one to five treatments) delivered over 1 to 2 weeks. Commonly used regimens include 18 Gy × 3, 12 Gy to 12.5 Gy × 4, and 10 Gy to 12 Gy × 5, and deliver a substantially higher biologically effective dose compared with historic conventional radiation therapy regimens.
Multiple prospective phase I/II trials and institutional series have demonstrated that SBRT results in a low incidence of pulmonary toxicity (<10% risk of symptomatic radiation pneumonitis), 2-year OS rates of 50% to 60%, and 2-year tumor control of 90% to 95%.[29-35][Level of evidence C1]
Evidence (SBRT):
- Early phase I/II trials from Indiana University identified the maximum tolerated dose of three-fraction SBRT at 18 Gy × 3 for T1 tumors.

Surgery is the treatment of choice for patients with stage II NSCLC. A lobectomy, pneumonectomy, segmental resection, wedge resection, or sleeve resection may be performed as appropriate. Careful preoperative assessment of the patient’s overall medical condition, especially the patient’s pulmonary reserve, is critical in considering the benefits of surgery. In addition to the immediate and age-related postoperative mortality rate, a 5% to 8% mortality rate with pneumonectomy or a 3% to 5% mortality rate with lobectomy can be expected.
Evidence (surgery):
- The Cochrane Collaboration reviewed 11 randomized trials with a total of 1,910 patients who underwent surgical interventions for early-stage (I–IIIA) lung cancer.[1] A pooled analysis of three trials reported the following:

---START CHUNK 873---
Four-year survival was superior in patients with resectable stage I, II, or IIIA NSCLC who underwent resection and complete ipsilateral mediastinal lymph node dissection (CMLND), compared with those who underwent resection and lymph node sampling; the hazard ratio (HR) was estimated to be 0.78 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.65–0.93; P = .005).[1][Level of evidence A1]
There was a significant reduction in any cancer recurrence (local or distant) in the CMLND group (relative risk [RR], 0.79; 95% CI, 0.66–0.95; P = .01) that appeared mainly as the result of a reduction in the number of distant recurrences (RR, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.61–1.00; P = .05).
There was no difference in operative mortality.
Air leak lasting more than 5 days was significantly more common in patients assigned to CMLND (RR, 2.94; 95% CI, 1.01–8.54; P = .05).

Evidence suggests that lung cancer resection combined with CMLND is not associated with improvement in survival compared with lung cancer resection combined with systematic sampling of mediastinal lymph nodes in patients with stage I, II, or IIIA NSCLC.[3][Level of evidence A1]
Conclusions about the efficacy of surgery for patients with local and locoregional NSCLC are limited by the small number of participants studied and potential methodological weaknesses of the trials.

The preponderance of evidence indicates that postoperative cisplatin combination chemotherapy provides a significant survival advantage to patients with resected stage II NSCLC. Preoperative chemotherapy may also provide survival benefit. The optimal sequence of surgery and chemotherapy and the benefits and risks of postoperative radiation therapy in patients with resectable NSCLC remain to be determined.
After surgery, many patients develop regional or distant metastases.[4] Several randomized controlled trials and meta-analyses have evaluated the use of postoperative chemotherapy in patients with stage I, II, and IIIA NSCLC.[5-11]
Evidence (adjuvant chemotherapy):
- Data on individual patient outcomes were collected and pooled into a meta-analysis from the five largest trials (4,584 patients) of cisplatin-based chemotherapy in patients with completely resected NSCLC that were conducted after 1995.[7]

---START CHUNK 879---
With a median follow-up time of 5.2 years, the overall HRdeath was 0.89 (95% CI, 0.82–0.96; P = .005), corresponding to a 5-year absolute benefit of 5.4% from chemotherapy.
The benefit varied with stage (test for trend, P = .04; HR for stage IA, 1.40; 95% CI, 0.95–2.06; HR for stage IB, 0.93; 95% CI, 0.78–1.10; HR for stage II, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.73–0.95; and HR for stage III, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.72–0.94).
The effect of chemotherapy did not vary significantly (test for interaction, P = .11) with the associated drugs, including vinorelbine (HR, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.70–0.91), etoposide or vinca alkaloid (HR, 0.92; 95% CI, 0.80–1.07), or other drugs (HR, 0.97; 95% CI, 0.84–1.13).
The greater effect on survival observed with the doublet of cisplatin plus vinorelbine compared with other regimens should be interpreted cautiously as the total dose of cisplatin received was significantly higher in patients treated with vinorelbine.

- With a median follow-up time of 5.2 years, the overall HRdeath was 0.89 (95% CI, 0.82–0.96; P = .005), corresponding to a 5-year absolute benefit of 5.4% from chemotherapy.

---START CHUNK 881---
- The meta-analysis [7] and the individual studies [5,12] support the administration of postoperative cisplatin-based chemotherapy in combination with vinorelbine.
Superior OS for the trial population and patients with stage II disease was reported for the Lung Adjuvant Cisplatin Evaluation (LACE) pooled analysis (pooled HR, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.73–0.95); the Adjuvant Navelbine International Trialist Association (ANITA) trial (HR, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.49–1.03); and the National Cancer Institute of Canada Clinical Trials Group JBR.10 trial (HR, 0.59; 95% CI, 0.42–0.85).

---START CHUNK 886---
Adjuvant targeted therapy with osimertinib for patients with EGFR-mutated NSCLC and resected stage IB to IIIA NSCLC was studied in a phase III clinical trial and showed improved OS.
Evidence (adjuvant targeted therapy with osimertinib for patients with stages IIA and IIB EGFR-mutated NSCLC):
- The ADAURA (NCT02511106) phase III, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial randomly assigned 682 patients with surgically resected stage IB to stage IIIA NSCLC with EGFR-sensitizing mutations (centrally determined, deletion in exon 19 or L858R mutation in exon 21) to receive osimertinib 80 mg by mouth daily or a placebo for 3 years. Standard postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy was allowed but not mandatory; decisions regarding adjuvant chemotherapy were made by the physician and patient before trial enrollment. There were 399 patients who received osimertinib and 342 patients who received placebo.[14][Level of evidence A1]

---START CHUNK 887---
In the overall population, the 5-year OS rate was 88% in the osimertinib group and 78% in the placebo group (overall HRdeath, 0.49; 95.03% CI, 0.34–0.70; P < .001).
Among patients with stage II to IIIA disease, the 5-year OS rate was 85% in the osimertinib group and 73% in the placebo group (overall HRdeath, 0.49; 95.03% CI, 0.33–0.73; P < .001).
The adverse event profile is consistent with other studies that used osimertinib except for pneumonia related to COVID-19, which was reported later.

Adjuvant immunotherapy for patients with resected stage IB to IIIA NSCLC has been found to significantly increase DFS.[15,16]
Evidence (adjuvant immunotherapy with pembrolizumab for patients with stage IIA and IIB tumors >4 cm):

---START CHUNK 891---
Evidence (adjuvant immunotherapy with pembrolizumab for patients with stage IIA and IIB tumors >4 cm):
- The phase III, multicenter, open-label PEARLS/KEYNOTE-091 trial (NCT02504372) randomly assigned 1,177 patients with completely resected stage IB (tumor >4 cm) to stage IIIA NSCLC to receive pembrolizumab (200 mg every 3 weeks) or placebo for up to 18 cycles, or until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients started study treatment after resection or, if indicated, after adjuvant chemotherapy (maximum of four cycles). The dual primary end points were DFS in the overall study population and DFS in patients with a programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) tumor proportion score (TPS) of 50% or greater, as determined using the PD-L1 IHC 22C3 pharmDx assay. These end points were reported in a prespecified interim analysis after a median follow-up of 35.6 months (interquartile range [IQR], 27.1–45.5).[15][Level of evidence B1]

---START CHUNK 892---
In the overall study population, the median DFS was 53.6 months (95% CI, 39.2–not reached [NR]) in the pembrolizumab group and 42.0 months (95% CI, 31.3–NR) in the placebo group (HR, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.63–0.91; P = .0014).
In the PD-L1 TPS ≥50% population, the median DFS was not reached with either pembrolizumab (95% CI, 44.3–NR) or placebo (95% CI, 35.8–NR) (HR, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.57–1.18; P = .14).

The FDA approved pembrolizumab as a single agent for adjuvant treatment following resection and platinum-based chemotherapy for patients with stage IB (T2a ≥4 cm), II, or IIIA NSCLC. Of note, the FDA label specifies that pembrolizumab can be used as adjuvant therapy after platinum-based chemotherapy. However, chemotherapy was not required in the overall study patient population evaluated in KEYNOTE-091.
Evidence (adjuvant immunotherapy with atezolizumab for patients with stages IIA and IIB NSCLC):

---START CHUNK 894---
Evidence (adjuvant immunotherapy with atezolizumab for patients with stages IIA and IIB NSCLC):
- IMpower010 (NCT02486718) was a phase III, multicenter, open-label trial that randomly assigned 1,005 patients with surgically resected stage IB (tumor >4 cm) to stage IIIA NSCLC. Patients received atezolizumab (1,200 mg every 21 days intravenously) or best supportive care for 16 cycles or 1 year after standard adjuvant platinum-based chemotherapy. Patients were enrolled after resection if they were eligible for cisplatin-based chemotherapy and were randomized after completion of chemotherapy if they remained eligible and did not experience disease progression. The primary end point was investigator-assessed DFS.[16]

---START CHUNK 895---
The primary end point was tested hierarchically, first in the stage II to IIIA population subgroup whose tumors expressed PD-L1 on at least 1% of tumor cells (using the SP263 antibody), then in all patients in the stage II to IIIA population, and finally in the intention-to-treat (ITT) population (stage IB to IIIA). Of the 882 patients who were randomly assigned and had stage II to IIIA disease, 476 had tumors expressing PD-L1 on at least 1% of tumor cells per SP263.[16][Level of evidence B1]
After a median follow-up of 32.2 months, atezolizumab treatment improved DFS compared with best supportive care in patients in the stage II to IIIA population whose tumors expressed PD-L1 on at least 1% of tumor cells (HR, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.50–0.88; P = .0039). At 24 months, the DFS rate was 74.6% for the atezolizumab group and 61.0% for the best supportive care group.

---START CHUNK 896---
Atezolizumab also improved DFS in all patients in the stage II to IIIA population (HR, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.64–0.96; P = .020). At 24 months, the DFS rate was 70.2% for the atezolizumab group and 61.6% for the best supportive care group.
In the ITT population, which included patients with stage IB to IIIA disease, HRDFS was 0.81 (95% CI, 0.67–0.99; P = .040). However, the boundary for statistical significance for DFS was not crossed.

The value of postoperative (adjuvant) radiation therapy (PORT) has been evaluated.[17]
Evidence (adjuvant radiation therapy):
- A meta-analysis, based on the results of ten randomized controlled trials and 2,232 individuals, reported the following:[17]
An 18% relative increase in the risk of death for patients who received PORT compared with surgery alone (HR, 1.18; P = .002). This is equivalent to an absolute detriment of 6% at 2 years (95% CI, 2%–9%), reducing OS from 58% to 52%. Exploratory subgroup analyses suggested that this detrimental effect was most pronounced for patients with stage I/II, N0 to N1 disease, whereas for patients with stage III, N2 disease there was no clear evidence of an adverse effect.
Results for local (HR, 1.13; P = .02), distant (HR, 1.14; P = .02), and overall (HR, 1.10; P = .06) recurrence-free survival similarly showed a detriment of PORT.[17][Level of evidence A1]

The role of chemotherapy before surgery was tested in clinical trials. The proposed benefits of preoperative chemotherapy include:
- A reduction in tumor size that may facilitate surgical resection.
- Early eradication of micrometastases.
- Better tolerability.
Preoperative chemotherapy may, however, delay potentially curative surgery.
Evidence (neoadjuvant chemotherapy):
- The Cochrane Collaboration reported a systematic review and meta-analysis of seven randomized controlled trials that included 988 patients and evaluated the addition of preoperative chemotherapy to surgery versus surgery alone. These trials evaluated patients with stages I, II, and IIIA NSCLC.[18]
Preoperative chemotherapy provided an absolute benefit in survival of 6% across all stages of disease, from 14% to 20% at 5 years (HR, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.69–0.97; P = .022).[18][Level of evidence A1]

The CheckMate 816 trial evaluated the combination of nivolumab (an anti-programmed death 1 antibody) and platinum-based chemotherapy as neoadjuvant therapy in patients with resectable (≥4 cm or node positive) NSCLC. Nivolumab therapy improved event-free survival (EFS) and pathological complete response rates compared with chemotherapy alone.
Evidence (nivolumab plus platinum-based chemotherapy):

---START CHUNK 910---
- CheckMate 816 (NCT02998528) was a phase III open-label trial that enrolled 358 patients with resectable stage IB to stage IIIA NSCLC. Notably, patients with stage IB disease had tumors measuring at least 4 cm and were classified according to the AJCC 7th edition staging criteria used for this trial; these tumors are now classified as stage IIA according to the AJCC 8th edition staging criteria. Patients were randomly assigned to receive nivolumab (360 mg) in combination with platinum-doublet chemotherapy or platinum-doublet chemotherapy alone every 3 weeks for three cycles before undergoing definitive surgery. The primary end points were EFS (defined as the time from randomization to any progression of disease precluding surgery, progression or recurrence of disease after surgery, progression of disease in the absence of surgery, or death from any cause) and pathological complete response (defined as 0% residual viable tumor cells in the primary tumor and sampled lymph nodes)

---START CHUNK 912---
With a minimum follow-up of 21 months, the median EFS was 31.6 months (95% CI, 30.2–NR) in the nivolumab-plus-chemotherapy group and 20.8 months (95% CI, 14.0–26.7) in the chemotherapy-alone group (HR, 0.63; 97.38% CI, 0.43–0.91; P = .005).
The estimated percentage of patients surviving without disease progression or disease recurrence at 1 year was 76.1% for patients who received nivolumab plus chemotherapy and 63.4% for patients who received chemotherapy alone. The magnitude of benefit was greater in 1) patients with stage IIIA disease versus patients with stage IB or II disease (HR, 0.54; 95% CI, 0.37–0.80 vs. HR, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.48–1.56), 2) patients with tumor PD-L1 expression ≥1% versus <1% (HR, 0.41; 95% CI, 0.24–0.70 vs. HR, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.54–1.32), and 3) patients with nonsquamous histology versus squamous histology.

---START CHUNK 913---
Pathological complete response was observed in 24% (95% CI, 18.0%– 31.0%) of patients who received nivolumab plus chemotherapy and 2.2% (95% CI, 0.6%–5.6%) of patients who received chemotherapy alone (odds ratio [OR], 13.94; 99% CI, 3.49–55.75; P < .001).
Median OS was not reached in either group (HRdeath, 0.57; 99.67% CI, 0.30–1.07; P = .008).
Grade 3 or 4 treatment-related adverse events occurred in 33.5% of patients in the nivolumab-plus-chemotherapy group and in 36.9% of patients in the chemotherapy-alone group. Treatment-related adverse events led to treatment discontinuation in 10.2% of patients in the nivolumab-plus-chemotherapy group and in 9.7% of patients in the chemotherapy-alone group.

---START CHUNK 917---
Several immune checkpoint inhibitors have been approved by the FDA for select patient populations with potentially resectable NSCLC, either in the neoadjuvant setting (nivolumab) or adjuvant setting (atezolizumab, durvalumab, or pembrolizumab). Ongoing phase III trials are evaluating the role of perioperative immune checkpoint inhibitors. These regimens for patients with potentially resectable stages II to III NSCLC include neoadjuvant immune checkpoint inhibitors with chemotherapy followed by surgery and adjuvant immune checkpoint inhibitors. Compared with neoadjuvant chemotherapy alone, early results from studies of perioperative immune checkpoint inhibitor regimens have shown improvements in several key outcomes including EFS, major pathological response, pathological complete response, and OS.

Evidence (neoadjuvant pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy and adjuvant pembrolizumab):
- The phase III double-blind KEYNOTE-671 (NCT03425643) trial randomly assigned 797 patients with untreated stage II, IIIA, or IIIB (≥1 ipsilateral mediastinal node or subcarinal node) NSCLC. Patients received neoadjuvant pembrolizumab (200 mg every 3 weeks) or placebo with cisplatin-based chemotherapy for four cycles, followed by surgery and adjuvant pembrolizumab or placebo for up to 13 cycles, or until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. The dual primary end points were EFS (defined as the time from randomization to local progression precluding surgery, unresectable tumor, progression or recurrence, or death) and OS. These end points were reported in a prespecified interim analysis after a median follow-up of 25.2 months (range, 7.5–50.6).[21][Level of evidence B1]

---START CHUNK 920---
The estimated 24-month EFS rate was 62.4% (95% CI, 56.8%–67.5%) for patients in the pembrolizumab group and 40.6% (95% CI, 34.8%–46.3%) for patients in the placebo group. Median EFS was not reached in the pembrolizumab group (95% CI, 34.1–NR) and was 17.0 months (95% CI, 14.3–22.0) in the placebo group (HRprogression, recurrence, or death, 0.58; 95% CI, 0.46–0.72; P < .001).
The EFS benefit with pembrolizumab was generally consistent across all subgroups.
The estimated 24-month OS rate was 80.9% in the pembrolizumab group and 77.6% in the placebo group (P = .02, not meeting the significance criterion).
Secondary end points were reported as follows:
Major pathological response occurred in 30.2% of patients in the pembrolizumab group and 11.0% of patients in the placebo group.

Evidence (durvalumab plus platinum-based chemotherapy):
- The phase III AEGEAN trial (NCT03800134) investigated perioperative durvalumab plus neoadjuvant chemotherapy compared with neoadjuvant chemotherapy alone in patients with resectable (stage II to IIIB [N2]) NSCLC. Patients received four cycles of treatment every 3 weeks before surgery, followed by adjuvant durvalumab or placebo intravenously every 4 weeks for 12 cycles. The modified intention-to-treat population (740 patients) included all patients who were randomly assigned, excluding patients with documented EGFR or ALK alterations. The first planned interim analysis occurred with 31.9% data maturity and at a median follow-up of 1 year. The primary end points were EFS and pathological complete response.[22][Level of evidence B1]
At 12 months, the EFS rate was 73.4% for patients who received durvalumab (95% CI, 67.9%–78.1%), and 64.5% for patients who received chemotherapy alone (95% CI, 58.8%–69.6%).

---START CHUNK 939---
Patients with potentially operable tumors with medical contraindications to surgery or those with inoperable stage II disease and with sufficient pulmonary reserve are candidates for radiation therapy with curative intent.[25] Primary radiation therapy often consists of approximately 60 Gy delivered with megavoltage equipment to the midplane of the volume of the known tumor using conventional fractionation. A boost to the cone down field of the primary tumor is frequently used to enhance local control. Careful treatment planning with precise definition of target volume and avoidance of critical normal structures, to the extent possible, is needed for optimal results; this requires the use of a simulator.
Among patients with excellent performance status, a 3-year survival rate of 20% may be expected if a course of radiation therapy with curative intent can be completed.

Patients with stage IIIA non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) are a heterogenous group. Patients may have metastases to ipsilateral mediastinal nodes, potentially resectable T3 tumors invading the chest wall, or mediastinal involvement with metastases to peribronchial or hilar lymph nodes (N1). Presentations of disease range from resectable tumors with microscopic metastases to lymph nodes to unresectable, bulky disease involving multiple nodal stations.

---START CHUNK 953---
Patients with clinical stage IIIA N2 disease have a 5-year overall survival (OS) rate of 10% to 15%; however, patients with bulky mediastinal involvement (i.e., visible on chest radiography) have a 5-year survival rate of 2% to 5%. Depending on clinical circumstances, the principal forms of treatment that are considered for patients with stage IIIA NSCLC are radiation therapy, chemotherapy, surgery, and combinations of these modalities.
Treatment options vary according to the location of the tumor and whether it is resectable.

The preponderance of evidence indicates that postoperative cisplatin combination chemotherapy provides a significant survival advantage to patients with resected NSCLC with occult N2 disease discovered at surgery. The optimal sequence of surgery and chemotherapy and the benefits and risks of postoperative radiation therapy in patients with resectable NSCLC are yet to be determined.

If complete resection of tumor and lymph nodes is possible, such patients may benefit from surgery followed by postoperative chemotherapy. Current evidence suggests that lung cancer resection combined with complete ipsilateral mediastinal lymph node dissection (CMLND) is not associated with improvement in survival compared with lung cancer resection combined with systematic sampling of mediastinal lymph nodes in patients with stage I, II, or IIIA NSCLC.[1][Level of evidence A1]
The addition of surgery to chemoradiation therapy for patients with stage IIIA NSCLC did not result in improved OS in a phase III trial but did improve progression-free survival (PFS) and local control.[2][Level of evidence B1]
Evidence (surgery):
- The Cochrane Collaboration reviewed 11 randomized trials with a total of 1,910 patients who underwent surgical interventions for early-stage (I–IIIA) lung cancer.[3] A pooled analysis of three trials reported the following:

---START CHUNK 960---
Four-year survival was superior in patients with resectable stage I, II, or IIIA NSCLC who underwent resection and CMLND, compared with those who underwent resection and lymph node sampling; the hazard ratio (HR) was estimated to be 0.78 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.65–0.93; P = .005).[3][Level of evidence A1]

- CMLND versus lymph node sampling was evaluated in a large randomized phase III trial (ACOSOG-Z0030). Preliminary analyses of operative morbidity and mortality showed comparable rates from the procedures.[4]
There was no difference in OS, disease-free survival (DFS), local recurrence, and regional recurrence.[1][Level of evidence A1]

The role of chemotherapy before surgery in patients with stage IIIA NSCLC has been extensively tested in clinical trials. The proposed benefits of preoperative (neoadjuvant) chemotherapy include:
- A reduction in tumor size that may facilitate surgical resection.
- Early eradication of micrometastases.
- Better tolerability.
Evidence (neoadjuvant chemotherapy):
- The Cochrane Collaboration provided a systematic review and meta-analysis of seven randomized controlled trials that included 988 patients and evaluated the addition of preoperative chemotherapy to surgery versus surgery alone.[5] These trials evaluated patients with stages I, II, and IIIA NSCLC.
Preoperative chemotherapy provided an absolute benefit in survival of 6% across all stages of disease, from 14% to 20% at 5 years (HR, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.69–0.97; P = .022).[5][Level of evidence A1]

This analysis was unable to address questions such as whether particular types of patients may benefit more or less from preoperative chemotherapy.[6]
- Preoperative chemotherapy provided an absolute benefit in survival of 6% across all stages of disease, from 14% to 20% at 5 years (HR, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.69–0.97; P = .022).[5][Level of evidence A1]
- This analysis was unable to address questions such as whether particular types of patients may benefit more or less from preoperative chemotherapy.[6]
- In the largest trial reported to date, 519 patients were randomly assigned to receive either surgery alone or three cycles of platinum-based chemotherapy followed by surgery.[7] Most patients (61%) had clinical stage I disease, 31% had stage II disease, and 7% had stage III disease.

---START CHUNK 965---
Postoperative complications were similar between groups, and no impairment of quality of life was observed.
There was no evidence of a benefit in terms of OS (HR, 1.02; 95% CI, 0.80–1.31; P = .86).
Updating the systematic review by addition of the present result suggests a 12% relative survival benefit with the addition of preoperative chemotherapy (1,507 patients; HR, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.76–1.01; P = .07), equivalent to an absolute improvement in survival of 5% at 5 years.[7]

Administering concurrent neoadjuvant chemotherapy and radiation therapy before surgery may intensify treatment and increase the likelihood of downstaging the tumor burden. Commonly used regimens that have been tested in the phase II setting include cisplatin/etoposide (EP5050) and weekly carboplatin/paclitaxel.[8,9] In a randomized trial of neoadjuvant chemoradiation therapy and surgery versus concurrent chemoradiation therapy alone, there was no difference in OS, but surgery improved PFS and local control.[2][Level of evidence B1]
Evidence (neoadjuvant chemoradiation therapy):
- The Intergroup-0139 trial (NCT00002550) compared chemoradiation therapy alone with neoadjuvant chemoradiation followed by surgery in 396 patients with stage IIIA (N2) NSCLC.[2]

The CheckMate 816 trial evaluated the combination of nivolumab (an anti-programmed death 1 antibody) and platinum-based chemotherapy as neoadjuvant therapy in patients with resectable (≥4 cm or node positive) NSCLC. Nivolumab therapy improved event-free survival (EFS) and pathological complete response rates compared with chemotherapy alone.
Evidence (nivolumab plus platinum-based chemotherapy):

---START CHUNK 972---
- CheckMate 816 (NCT02998528) was a phase III open-label trial that enrolled 358 patients with resectable stage IB to stage IIIA NSCLC. Notably, patients with stage IB disease had tumors measuring at least 4 cm and were classified according to the AJCC 7th edition staging criteria used for this trial; these tumors are now classified as stage IIA according to the AJCC 8th edition staging criteria. Patients were randomly assigned to receive nivolumab (360 mg) in combination with platinum-doublet chemotherapy or platinum-doublet chemotherapy alone every 3 weeks for three cycles before undergoing definitive surgery. The primary end points were EFS (defined as the time from randomization to any progression of disease precluding surgery, progression or recurrence of disease after surgery, progression of disease in the absence of surgery, or death from any cause) and pathological complete response (defined as 0% residual viable tumor cells in the primary tumor and sampled lymph nodes)

---START CHUNK 974---
With a minimum follow-up of 21 months, the median EFS was 31.6 months (95% CI, 30.2–not reached [NR]) in the nivolumab-plus-chemotherapy group and 20.8 months (95% CI, 14.0–26.7) in the chemotherapy-alone group (HR, 0.63; 97.38% CI, 0.43–0.91; P = .005).
The estimated percentage of patients surviving without disease progression or disease recurrence at 1 year was 76.1% for patients who received nivolumab plus chemotherapy and 63.4% for patients who received chemotherapy alone. The magnitude of benefit was greater in 1) patients with stage IIIA disease versus patients with stage IB or II disease (HR, 0.54; 95% CI, 0.37–0.80 vs. HR, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.48–1.56), 2) patients with tumor programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression ≥1% versus <1% (HR, 0.41; 95% CI, 0.24–0.70 vs. HR, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.54–1.32), and 3) patients with nonsquamous histology versus squamous histology.

---START CHUNK 975---
Pathological complete response was observed in 24% (95% CI, 18.0%– 31.0%) of patients who received nivolumab plus chemotherapy and 2.2% (95% CI, 0.6%–5.6%) of patients who received chemotherapy alone (odds ratio, 13.94; 99% CI, 3.49–55.75; P < .001).

In the ITT population, the PFS rate was 69.6% (95% CI, 54.1%–80.7%) at 36 and 42 months. In the per-protocol population, the PFS rate was 81.1% (95% CI, 64.4%–90.5%) at 36 and 42 months.
Major pathological response was defined as the presence of 10% or fewer tumor cells in the primary tumor. A total of 82.9% of patients had a major pathological response, including 63.4% of patients who had a complete pathological response. A total of 17.1% patients had an incomplete response.
Tumor mutational burden and PD-L1 status were not predictive of survival.
Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) from plasma samples obtained before and after neoadjuvant treatment (but before surgery) was analyzed with the hybridization capture–based TruSight Oncology 500 ctDNA next-generation sequencing assay on a NovaSeq sequencer (Illumina).

Several immune checkpoint inhibitors have been approved by the FDA for select patient populations with potentially resectable NSCLC, either in the neoadjuvant setting (nivolumab) or adjuvant setting (atezolizumab, durvalumab, or pembrolizumab). Ongoing phase III trials are evaluating the role of perioperative immune checkpoint inhibitors. These regimens for patients with potentially resectable stages II to III NSCLC include neoadjuvant immune checkpoint inhibitors with chemotherapy followed by surgery and adjuvant immune checkpoint inhibitors. Compared with neoadjuvant chemotherapy alone, early results from studies of perioperative immune checkpoint inhibitor regimens have shown improvements in several key outcomes including EFS, major pathological response, pathological complete response, and OS.

Evidence (neoadjuvant pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy and adjuvant pembrolizumab):
- The phase III double-blind KEYNOTE-671 (NCT03425643) trial randomly assigned 797 patients with untreated stage II, IIIA, or IIIB (≥1 ipsilateral mediastinal node or subcarinal node) NSCLC. Patients received neoadjuvant pembrolizumab (200 mg every 3 weeks) or placebo with cisplatin-based chemotherapy for four cycles, followed by surgery and adjuvant pembrolizumab or placebo for up to 13 cycles, or until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. The dual primary end points were EFS (defined as the time from randomization to local progression precluding surgery, unresectable tumor, progression or recurrence, or death) and OS. These end points were reported in a prespecified interim analysis after a median follow-up of 25.2 months (range, 7.5–50.6).[12][Level of evidence B1]

---START CHUNK 987---
The estimated 24-month EFS rate was 62.4% (95% CI, 56.8%–67.5%) for patients in the pembrolizumab group and 40.6% (95% CI, 34.8%–46.3%) for patients in the placebo group. Median EFS was not reached in the pembrolizumab group (95% CI, 34.1–NR) and was 17.0 months (95% CI, 14.3–22.0) in the placebo group (HRprogression, recurrence, or death, 0.58; 95% CI, 0.46–0.72; P < .001).

Patients were stratified by tumor histology, PD-L1 expression, and disease stage. A total of 461 patients were randomly assigned 1:1 to receive either neoadjuvant nivolumab plus platinum-doublet chemotherapy for four cycles, surgery, and adjuvant nivolumab for 12 months or neoadjuvant platinum-doublet chemotherapy alone followed by surgery.

Patients with completely resected stage IIIA NSCLC may benefit from postoperative cisplatin-based chemotherapy.[16][Level of evidence A1]
Evidence (adjuvant chemotherapy):
Evidence from randomized controlled clinical trials indicates that when stage IIIA NSCLC is encountered unexpectedly at surgery, chemotherapy given after complete resection improves survival.
Several randomized, controlled trials and meta-analyses have evaluated the use of postoperative chemotherapy in patients with stages I, II, and IIIA NSCLC.[16-22]
- Data on individual patient outcomes from the five largest trials (4,584 patients) that were conducted after 1995 of cisplatin-based chemotherapy in patients with completely resected NSCLC were collected and pooled into a meta-analysis.[16]
With a median follow-up of 5.2 years, the overall HRdeath was 0.89 (95% CI, 0.82–0.96; P = .005), corresponding to a 5-year absolute benefit of 5.4% from chemotherapy.

The effect of chemotherapy did not vary significantly (test for interaction, P = .11) with the associated drugs, including vinorelbine (HR, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.70–0.91), etoposide or vinca alkaloid (HR, 0.92; 95% CI, 0.80–1.07), or other drugs (HR, 0.97; 95% CI, 0.84–1.13).
The benefit varied with stage (HR for stage IIIA, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.72–0.94).
The greater effect on survival observed with the doublet of cisplatin plus vinorelbine compared with other regimens should be interpreted with caution as the total dose of cisplatin received was significantly higher in patients treated with vinorelbine.

Adjuvant targeted therapy with osimertinib for patients with EGFR-mutated NSCLC and resected stage IB to IIIA NSCLC was studied in a phase III clinical trial and showed improved OS.
Evidence (adjuvant targeted therapy with osimertinib for patients with stage IIIA EGFR-mutated NSCLC):
- The ADAURA (NCT02511106) phase III, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial randomly assigned 682 patients with surgically resected stage IB to stage IIIA NSCLC with EGFR-sensitizing mutations (centrally determined, deletion in exon 19 or L858R mutation in exon 21) to osimertinib 80 mg by mouth daily or a placebo for 3 years. Standard postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy was allowed but not mandatory; decisions regarding adjuvant chemotherapy were made by the physician and patient before trial enrollment. There were 399 patients who received osimertinib and 342 patients who received placebo.[24][Level of evidence A1]

Adjuvant immunotherapy for patients with resected stage IB to IIIA NSCLC has been found to significantly increase DFS.[25,26]
Evidence (adjuvant immunotherapy with pembrolizumab for patients with stage IIIA NSCLC):

---START CHUNK 1017---
Evidence (adjuvant immunotherapy with pembrolizumab for patients with stage IIIA NSCLC):
- The phase III, multicenter, open-label PEARLS/KEYNOTE-091 trial (NCT02504372) randomly assigned 1,177 patients with completely resected stage IB (tumor >4 cm) to stage IIIA NSCLC to receive pembrolizumab (200 mg every 3 weeks) or placebo for up to 18 cycles, or until disease progression, or unacceptable toxicity. Patients started study treatment after resection or, if indicated, after adjuvant chemotherapy (maximum of four cycles). The dual primary end points were DFS in the overall study population and DFS in patients with a PD-L1 tumor proportion score (TPS) of 50% or greater, as determined using the PD-L1 IHC 22C3 pharmDx assay. These end points were reported in a prespecified interim analysis after a median follow-up of 35.6 months (interquartile range, 27.1–45.5).[25][Level of evidence B1]

---START CHUNK 1018---
In the overall study population, the median DFS was 53.6 months (95% CI, 39.2 to NR) in the pembrolizumab group and 42.0 months (95% CI, 31.3–NR) in the placebo group (HR, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.63–0.91, P = .0014).
In the PD-L1 TPS ≥50% population, the median DFS was not reached with either pembrolizumab (95% CI, 44.3–NR) or placebo (95% CI, 35.8–NR) (HR, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.57–1.18; P = .14).
OS data were immature at the time of prespecified interim analysis.
No new safety signals were identified in this study.

The FDA approved pembrolizumab as a single agent for adjuvant treatment following resection and platinum-based chemotherapy for patients with stage IB (T2a ≥4 cm), II, or IIIA NSCLC. Of note, the FDA label specifies that pembrolizumab can be used as adjuvant therapy after platinum-based chemotherapy. However, chemotherapy was not required in the overall study patient population evaluated in KEYNOTE-091.
Evidence (adjuvant immunotherapy with atezolizumab for patients with resected stage IIIA NSCLC):

---START CHUNK 1020---
Evidence (adjuvant immunotherapy with atezolizumab for patients with resected stage IIIA NSCLC):
- IMpower010 (NCT02486718) was a phase III, multicenter, open-label trial that randomly assigned 1,005 patients with surgically resected stage IB (tumor >4 cm) to stage IIIA NSCLC. Patients received atezolizumab (1,200 mg every 21 days intravenously) or best supportive care for 16 cycles or 1 year after standard adjuvant platinum-based chemotherapy. Patients were enrolled after resection if they were eligible for cisplatin-based chemotherapy and were randomized after completion of chemotherapy if they remained eligible and did not experience disease progression. The primary end point was investigator-assessed DFS.[26]

---START CHUNK 1021---
The primary end point was tested hierarchically, first in the stage II to IIIA population subgroup whose tumors expressed PD-L1 on at least 1% of tumor cells (using the SP263 antibody), then in all patients in the stage II to IIIA population, and finally in the ITT population (stage IB to IIIA). Of the 882 patients who were randomly assigned and had stage II to IIIA disease, 476 had tumors expressing PD-L1 on at least 1% of tumor cells per SP263.[26][Level of evidence B1]
After a median follow-up of 32.2 months, atezolizumab treatment improved DFS compared with best supportive care in patients in the stage II to IIIA population whose tumors expressed PD-L1 on at least 1% of tumor cells (HR, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.50–0.88; P = .0039). At 24 months, the DFS rate was 74.6% for the atezolizumab group and 61.0% for the best supportive care group.

---START CHUNK 1022---
Atezolizumab also improved DFS in all patients in the stage II to IIIA population (HR, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.64–0.96; P = .020). At 24 months, the DFS rate was 70.2% for the atezolizumab group and 61.6% for the best supportive care group.
In the ITT population, which included patients with stage IB to IIIA disease, HRDFS was 0.81 (95% CI, 0.67–0.99; P = .040). However, the boundary for statistical significance for DFS was not crossed.
OS data are immature.

Combination chemotherapy and radiation therapy administered before or following surgery should be viewed as investigational and requiring evaluation in future clinical trials.
Evidence (adjuvant chemoradiation therapy):
- Five randomized trials have assessed the value of postoperative combination chemoradiation therapy versus radiation therapy following surgical resection.[5,7,27-29][Level of evidence A1]
Only one trial reported improved DFS, and no trial reported improved OS.
- Only one trial reported improved DFS, and no trial reported improved OS.

---START CHUNK 1027---
Only one trial reported improved DFS, and no trial reported improved OS.
- Only one trial reported improved DFS, and no trial reported improved OS.
- Three trials have evaluated platinum-based combination chemotherapy followed by surgery versus platinum-based chemotherapy followed by radiation therapy (60–69.6 Gy) alone to determine whether surgery or radiation therapy was most efficacious.[29-31] Although the studies were small, enrolling 73 (Radiation Therapy Oncology Group [RTOG]) (RTOG 89-01), 107 (The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center), and 333 (European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer [EORTC-08941; NCT00002623]) patients with stage IIIA (N2) disease, no trial reported a difference in local control or survival.[29-31][Level of evidence A1]

---START CHUNK 1028---
In the largest series (EORTC-08941), 579 patients with histologically- or cytologically-proven stage IIIA (N2) NSCLC were given three cycles of platinum-based induction chemotherapy.[31] The 333 responding patients were subsequently randomly assigned to surgical resection or radiation therapy. Of the 154 patients (92%) who underwent surgery, 50% had a radical resection, 42% had a pathological downstaging, and 5% had a pathological complete response; 4% died after surgery. Postoperative (adjuvant) radiation therapy (PORT) was administered to 62 patients (40%) in the surgery arm. Among the 154 patients (93%) who received radiation therapy, overall compliance to the radiation therapy prescription was 55%, and grade 3 to 4 acute and late esophageal and pulmonary toxic effects occurred in 4% and 7% of patients; one patient died of radiation pneumonitis.

---START CHUNK 1029---
Median OS was 16.4 months for patients assigned to resection versus 17.5 months for patients assigned to radiation therapy; the 5-year OS rate was 15.7% for patients assigned to resection versus 14% for patients assigned to radiation therapy (HR, 1.06; 95% CI, 0.84–1.35).[31]
Rates of PFS were also similar in both groups. In view of its low morbidity and mortality, it was concluded that radiation therapy should be considered the preferred locoregional treatment for these patients.[31]

The value of PORT has been assessed.[27] Although some studies suggest that PORT can improve local control for node-positive patients whose tumors were resected, it remains controversial whether it can improve survival. The optimal dose of thoracic PORT is not known at this time. Most studies cited used doses ranging from 30 Gy to 60 Gy, typically provided in 2 Gy to 2.5 Gy fractions.[27]
As referred to in the National Cancer Institute of Canada (NCIC) Clinical Trials Group JBR.10 study (NCT00002583), PORT may be considered in selected patients to reduce the risk of local recurrence, if any of the following are present:[23]
- Involvement of multiple nodal stations.
- Extracapsular tumor spread.
- Close or microscopically positive resection margins.

Evidence from one large meta-analysis, subset analyses of randomized trials, and one large population study suggest that PORT may reduce local recurrence. Results from these studies on the effect of PORT on OS are conflicting.
- A meta-analysis of ten randomized trials that evaluated PORT versus surgery alone showed the following:
No difference in OS for the entire PORT group or for the subset of N2 patients.[18][Level of evidence A1]
- No difference in OS for the entire PORT group or for the subset of N2 patients.[18][Level of evidence A1]

- Results from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program [28] suggest the following:

- The large SEER retrospective study (N = 7,465) found superior survival rates associated with radiation therapy in N2 disease (HR, 0.855; 95% CI, 0.762–0.959).
There is benefit of PORT in stage IIIA (N2) disease, and the role of PORT in early stages of NSCLC should be clarified in ongoing phase III trials. Further analysis is needed to determine whether these outcomes can be modified with technical improvements, better definitions of target volumes, and limitation of cardiac volume in the radiation portals.[18]

The addition of sequential and concurrent chemotherapy to radiation therapy has been evaluated in prospective randomized trials and meta-analyses. Overall, concurrent treatment may provide the greatest benefit in survival with an increase in toxic effects.
Concomitant platinum-based radiation chemotherapy may improve survival of patients with locally advanced NSCLC. However, the available data are insufficient to accurately define the size of such a potential treatment benefit and the optimal schedule of chemotherapy.[32]
Evidence (chemoradiation therapy):

The results from two randomized trials (including RTOG-9410 [NCT01134861]) and a meta-analysis indicate that concurrent chemotherapy and radiation therapy may provide greater survival benefit, albeit with more toxic effects, than sequential chemotherapy and radiation therapy.[35-37][Level of evidence A1]
Evidence (concurrent vs. sequential chemoradiation therapy):
- In the first trial, the combination of mitomycin C, vindesine, and cisplatin were given concurrently with split-course daily radiation therapy to 56 Gy compared with chemotherapy followed by continuous daily radiation therapy to 56 Gy.[35]
Five-year OS rates favored concurrent therapy (27% vs. 9%).

Median and 5-year survival were superior in the concurrent chemotherapy with daily radiation therapy arm (17 months vs. 14.6 months and 16% vs. 10% for sequential regimen [P = .046]).[37]

---START CHUNK 1045---

With improvement in radiation therapy–delivery technology in the 1990s, including tumor-motion management and image guidance, phase I/II trials demonstrated the feasibility of dose-escalation radiation therapy to 74 Gy with concurrent chemotherapy.[39-41] However, a phase III trial of a conventional dose of 60 Gy versus dose escalation to 74 Gy with concurrent weekly carboplatin/paclitaxel did not demonstrate improved local control or PFS, and OS was worse with dose escalation (HR, 1.38; 95% CI, 1.09–1.76; P = .004). There was a nonsignificant increase in grade 5 events with dose escalation (10% vs. 2%) and higher incidence of grade 3 esophagitis (21% vs. 7%; P = .0003). Thus, there is no clear benefit in radiation dose escalation beyond 60 Gy for stage III NSCLC.[42][Level of evidence A1]

---START CHUNK 1050---
Evidence (consolidation therapy following concurrent chemoradiation):
- The randomized phase III PROCLAIM study [NCT00686959] enrolled 598 patients with newly diagnosed, stage IIIA/B, unresectable, nonsquamous NSCLC.[43] Patients were randomly assigned on a 1:1 ratio to either of two arms:
Arm A: Pemetrexed (500 mg/m2) and cisplatin (75 mg/m2) intravenously every 3 weeks for three cycles plus concurrent thoracic radiation therapy (60 to 66 Gy) followed by pemetrexed consolidation every 3 weeks for four cycles.
Arm B: Standard therapy with etoposide (50 mg/m2) and cisplatin (50 mg/m2) intravenously every 4 weeks for two cycles plus concurrent thoracic radiation therapy (60 to 66 Gy) followed by two cycles of consolidation platinum-based doublet chemotherapy.

---START CHUNK 1051---
The primary objective was OS. The study was designed as a superiority trial with 80% power to detect an OS HR of 0.74 with a type 1 error of .05. This study randomly assigned 598 patients (arm A, 301; arm B, 297) and treated 555 patients (arm A, 283; arm B, 272).
Enrollment was stopped early because of futility.
OS in arm A was not superior to arm B (HR, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.79–1.20; median, 26.8 vs. 25.0 months; P = .831).
Arm A had a significantly lower incidence of any drug-related grade 3 to 4 adverse events (64.0% vs. 76.8%; P = .001), including neutropenia (24.4% vs. 44.5%; P < .001), during the overall treatment period.
- Arm A: Pemetrexed (500 mg/m2) and cisplatin (75 mg/m2) intravenously every 3 weeks for three cycles plus concurrent thoracic radiation therapy (60 to 66 Gy) followed by pemetrexed consolidation every 3 weeks for four cycles.

The primary objective was OS. The study was designed as a superiority trial with 80% power to detect an OS HR of 0.74 with a type 1 error of .05. This study randomly assigned 598 patients (arm A, 301; arm B, 297) and treated 555 patients (arm A, 283; arm B, 272).
- Enrollment was stopped early because of futility.
- OS in arm A was not superior to arm B (HR, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.79–1.20; median, 26.8 vs. 25.0 months; P = .831).
- Arm A had a significantly lower incidence of any drug-related grade 3 to 4 adverse events (64.0% vs. 76.8%; P = .001), including neutropenia (24.4% vs. 44.5%; P < .001), during the overall treatment period.

---START CHUNK 1054---
Durvalumab is a selective human IgG1 monoclonal antibody that blocks PD-L1 binding to programmed death 1 (PD-1) and CD80, allowing T cells to recognize and kill tumor cells.[44]
Evidence (durvalumab following concurrent chemoradiation):
- The phase III PACIFIC trial (NCT02125461) enrolled 713 patients with stage III NSCLC whose disease had not progressed after two or more cycles of platinum-based chemoradiation therapy. Patients were randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to receive durvalumab (10 mg/kg intravenously) or placebo (every 2 weeks for up to 12 months).[44]
At a median follow-up of 34.2 months for all patients and 61.6 months for censored patients, the median OS was 47.5 months for all patients and 29.1 months for censored patients (stratified HR, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.59–0.89). The median PFS was 16.9 months in the durvalumab group and 5.6 months in the placebo group (stratified HR, 0.55; 95% CI, 0.45–0.68).

---START CHUNK 1055---
The estimated 5-year OS rates were 42.9% (95% CI, 38.2%–47.4%) in the durvalumab group and 33.4% (95% CI, 27.3%–39.6%) in the placebo group.[45][Level of evidence A1]
The estimated 5-year PFS rates were 33.1% (95% CI, 28.0%–38.2%) in the durvalumab group and 19% (95% CI, 13.6%–25.2%) in the placebo group.
Grade 3 or 4 adverse events occurred in 29.9% of patients treated with durvalumab and in 26.1% of patients treated with placebo. The most common adverse event of grade 3 or 4 was pneumonia in 4.4% of the patients who received durvalumab and in 3.8% of the patients who received placebo.
- At a median follow-up of 34.2 months for all patients and 61.6 months for censored patients, the median OS was 47.5 months for all patients and 29.1 months for censored patients (stratified HR, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.59–0.89).

---START CHUNK 1058---
Evidence (osimertinib following concurrent chemoradiation therapy):
- The phase III, double-blind, placebo-controlled LAURA trial (NCT03521154) included patients with unresectable EGFR-mutated stage III NSCLC who had not progressed during or after definitive chemoradiation therapy. A total of 216 patients who had undergone chemoradiation therapy were randomly assigned to receive either osimertinib (n = 143) or placebo (n = 73). The primary end point was PFS as assessed by blinded independent central review.[46]
The median PFS was 39.1 months with osimertinib and 5.6 months with placebo (HRdisease progression or death, 0.16; 95% CI, 0.10–0.24; P < .001).
At 36 months, the OS rate was 84% for patients in the osimertinib group (95% CI, 75%–89%) and 74% for patients in the placebo group (95% CI, 57%–85%) (HRdeath, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.42–1.56; P = .53) (at 20% data maturity).[46][Level of evidence A1]

---START CHUNK 1059---
Grade 3 or higher adverse events occurred in 35% of patients in the osimertinib group and 12% of patients in the placebo group. Radiation pneumonitis was reported in 48% of patients in the osimertinib group and 38% of patients in the placebo group.
- The median PFS was 39.1 months with osimertinib and 5.6 months with placebo (HRdisease progression or death, 0.16; 95% CI, 0.10–0.24; P < .001).

Radiation therapy alone may provide benefit to patients with locally advanced unresectable stage IIIA NSCLC.
Radiation therapy with traditional dose and fractionation schedules (1.8–2.0 Gy per fraction per day to 60–70 Gy in 6–7 weeks) results in reproducible long-term survival benefit in 5% to 10% of patients and significant palliation of symptoms.[51]
Evidence (radiation therapy for locally advanced unresectable tumor):
- One prospective randomized clinical study showed the following:[52]
Radiation therapy given continuously (including weekends) as three daily fractions (continuous hyperfractionated accelerated radiation therapy) improved OS compared with radiation therapy given as one daily fraction.[52][Level of evidence A1]
Patterns of failure for patients treated with radiation therapy alone included both locoregional and distant failures.

Although patients with unresectable stage IIIA disease may benefit from radiation therapy, long-term outcomes have generally been poor because of local and systemic relapse.

---START CHUNK 1065---
Radiation therapy may be effective in palliating symptomatic local involvement with NSCLC, such as:
- Tracheal, esophageal, or bronchial compression.
- Pain.
- Vocal cord paralysis.
- Hemoptysis.
- Superior vena cava syndrome.
In some cases, endobronchial laser therapy and/or brachytherapy has been used to alleviate proximal obstructing lesions.[53]
Evidence (radiation therapy for palliative treatment):
- A systematic review identified six randomized trials of high-dose rate endobronchial brachytherapy (HDREB) alone or with external-beam radiation therapy (EBRT) or laser therapy.[54]
Better overall symptom palliation and fewer re-treatments were required in previously untreated patients using EBRT alone.[54][Level of evidence A3]
Although EBRT is frequently prescribed for symptom palliation, there is no consensus about when the fractionation scheme should be used.

---START CHUNK 1066---
Although EBRT is frequently prescribed for symptom palliation, there is no consensus about when the fractionation scheme should be used.
For EBRT, different multifraction regimens appear to provide similar symptom relief;[55-60] however, single-fraction radiation therapy may be insufficient for symptom relief compared with hypofractionated or standard regimens, as seen in the NCIC Clinical Trials Group trial (NCT00003685).[57][Level of evidence A3]
Evidence of a modest increase in survival in patients with better performance status given high-dose EBRT is available.[55,56][Level of evidence A1]
HDREB provided palliation of symptomatic patients with recurrent endobronchial obstruction previously treated by EBRT, when it was technically feasible.

---START CHUNK 1069---
Treatment options for superior sulcus tumors include:
- Surgery.
- Chemoradiation therapy followed by surgery.
- Radiation therapy alone.
NSCLC of the superior sulcus, frequently termed Pancoast tumors, occurs in less than 5% of patients.[61,62] Superior sulcus tumors usually arise from the apex of the lung and are challenging to treat because of their proximity to structures at the thoracic inlet. At this location, tumors may invade the parietal pleura, chest wall, brachial plexus, subclavian vessels, stellate ganglion, and adjacent vertebral bodies. However, Pancoast tumors are amenable to curative treatment, especially in patients with T3, N0 disease.
Adverse prognostic factors include the presence of mediastinal nodal metastases (N2 disease), spine or subclavian-vessel involvement (T4 disease), and limited resection (R1 or R2).

---START CHUNK 1072---
Evidence (chemoradiation therapy):
- Two large, prospective, multicenter phase II trials have evaluated induction chemoradiation therapy followed by resection.[64,65]
In the first trial (NCT00002642), 110 eligible patients were enrolled with mediastinoscopy negative, clinical T3–4, N0–1 tumors of the superior sulcus.[65] Induction treatment was two cycles of etoposide and cisplatin with 45 Gy of concurrent radiation therapy.
The induction regimen was well tolerated, and only five participants had grade 3 or higher toxic effects.
Induction chemoradiation therapy could sterilize the primary lesion. Induction therapy was completed by 104 patients (95%). Of the 95 patients eligible for surgery, 88 (80%) underwent thoracotomy, two (1.8%) died postoperatively, and 83 (76%) had complete resections.

---START CHUNK 1073---
Pathological complete response or minimal microscopic disease was seen in 61 (56%) resection specimens. Pathological complete response led to better survival than when any residual disease was present (P = .02).
Five-year survival was 44% for all patients and 54% after complete resection, with no difference between T3 and T4 tumors. Disease progression occurred mainly in distant sites.
In the second trial, 75 patients were enrolled and treated with induction therapy with mitomycin C, vindesine, and cisplatin combined with 45 Gy of radiation therapy.[64] Fifty-seven patients (76%) underwent surgical resection, and complete resection was achieved in 51 patients (68%).
There were 12 patients with pathological complete response.
Major postoperative morbidity, including chylothorax, empyema, pneumonitis, adult respiratory distress syndrome, and bleeding, was observed in eight patients. There were three treatment-related deaths.

---START CHUNK 1074---

With improvement in radiation therapy–delivery technology in the 1990s, including tumor-motion management and image guidance, phase I/II trials demonstrated the feasibility of dose-escalation radiation therapy to 74 Gy with concurrent chemotherapy.[39-41] However, a phase III trial of a conventional dose of 60 Gy versus dose escalation to 74 Gy with concurrent weekly carboplatin/paclitaxel did not demonstrate improved local control or PFS, and OS was worse with dose escalation (HR, 1.38 [1.09–1.76]; P = .004). There was a nonsignificant increase in grade 5 events with dose escalation (10% vs. 2%) and higher incidence of grade 3 esophagitis (21% vs. 7%; P = .0003). Thus, there is no clear benefit in radiation dose escalation beyond 60 Gy for stage III NSCLC.[42][Level of evidence A1]

While radiation therapy is an integral part of the treatment of Pancoast tumors, variations in dose, treatment technique, and staging that were used in various published series make it difficult to determine its effectiveness.[61,62]
Small, retrospective series of radiation therapy in patients who were only clinically staged have reported 5-year survival rates of 0% to 40%, depending on T stage, total radiation dose, and other prognostic factors. Induction radiation therapy and en bloc resection was shown to be potentially curative.
Evidence (radiation therapy):
- In the preoperative setting, a dose of 45 Gy over 5 weeks is generally recommended, while a dose of approximately 61 Gy is required when using definitive radiation therapy as the primary modality.[61,62]

Section: Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Treatment (PDQ®)–Health Professional Version > Treatment of Stage IIIA NSCLC > Treatment Options for Tumors That Invade the Chest Wall

---START CHUNK 1083---
Treatment options for tumors that invade the chest wall include:
- Surgery.
- Surgery and radiation therapy.
- Radiation therapy alone.
- Chemotherapy combined with radiation therapy and/or surgery.
Selected patients with bulky primary tumors that directly invade the chest wall can obtain long-term survival with surgical management provided that their tumor is completely resected.
Evidence (radical surgery):
- In a small case series of 97 patients, the 5-year survival rate of patients who had completely resected T3, N0, M0 disease was 44.2%. For patients with completely resected T3, N1, M0 disease, the 5-year survival rate was 40.0%. In patients with completely resected T3, N2, M0 disease, the 5-year survival rate was 6.2%.[66][Level of evidence C2]

---START CHUNK 1084---
- In a small case series of 104 patients, the 5-year survival rate of patients who had completely resected T3, N0, M0 disease was 67.3%. For patients with completely resected T3, N1, M0 disease, the 5-year survival rate was 100.0%. In patients with completely resected T3, N2, M0 disease, the 5-year survival rate was 17.9%.[67][Level of evidence C2]
- In a case series of 309 patients treated at three centers, patients who underwent en bloc resection had superior outcomes compared with patients who underwent extrapleural resections (60.3% vs. 39.1%; P = .03).[68][Level of evidence C2]
Adjuvant chemotherapy is recommended, and radiation therapy is reserved for cases with unclear resection margins. Survival rates were lower in patients who underwent incomplete resection and had mediastinal lymph node involvement. Combined-modality approaches have been evaluated to improve ability to achieve complete resection.

In general, patients with stages IIIB and IIIC NSCLC do not benefit from surgery alone and are best managed by initial chemotherapy, chemotherapy plus radiation therapy, or radiation therapy alone, depending on:
- Sites of tumor involvement.

---START CHUNK 1113---
- Sites of tumor involvement.
- The patient's performance status.
Most patients with excellent performance status are candidates for combined-modality chemotherapy and radiation therapy with the following exceptions:
- Selected patients with T4, N0 disease may be treated with combined-modality therapy and surgery similar to patients with superior sulcus tumors.
Patients with stages IIIB or IIIC NSCLC are candidates for clinical trials, which may lead to improvement in the control of disease.

Many randomized studies of patients with unresectable stage III NSCLC show that treatment with preoperative or concurrent cisplatin-based chemotherapy and radiation therapy to the chest is associated with improved survival compared with treatment that uses radiation therapy alone. Although patients with unresectable stages IIIB or IIIC disease may benefit from radiation therapy, long-term outcomes have generally been poor, often the result of local and systemic relapse. The addition of sequential and concurrent chemotherapy to radiation therapy has been evaluated in prospective randomized trials.
Evidence (sequential or concurrent chemotherapy and radiation therapy):
- A meta-analysis of patient data from 11 randomized clinical trials showed the following:[5]
Cisplatin-based combinations plus radiation therapy resulted in a 10% reduction in the risk of death compared with radiation therapy alone.[5][Level of evidence A1]

- A meta-analysis of 13 trials (based on 2,214 evaluable patients) showed the following:[6]
The addition of concurrent chemotherapy to radical radiation therapy reduced the risk of death at 2 years (relative risk [RR], 0.93; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.88–0.98; P = .01).
For the 11 trials with platinum-based chemotherapy, RR was 0.93 (95% CI, 0.87–0.99; P = .02).[6]
- The addition of concurrent chemotherapy to radical radiation therapy reduced the risk of death at 2 years (relative risk [RR], 0.93; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.88–0.98; P = .01).

---START CHUNK 1117---
- For the 11 trials with platinum-based chemotherapy, RR was 0.93 (95% CI, 0.87–0.99; P = .02).[6]
- A meta-analysis of individual data from 1,764 patients evaluated nine trials.[7]
The hazard ratio (HR)death among patients treated with radiation therapy and chemotherapy compared with radiation therapy alone was 0.89 (95% CI, 0.81–0.98; P = .02) corresponding to an absolute benefit of chemotherapy of 4% at 2 years.
The combination of platinum with etoposide appeared to be more effective than platinum alone. Concomitant platinum-based chemotherapy and radiation therapy may improve survival of patients with locally advanced NSCLC. However, the available data are insufficient to accurately define the size of such a potential treatment benefit and the optimal schedule of chemotherapy.[7]

- The results from two randomized trials (including RTOG-9410 [NCT01134861]) and a meta-analysis indicate that concurrent chemotherapy and radiation therapy provide greater survival benefit, albeit with more toxic effects, than sequential chemotherapy and radiation therapy.[8-10][Level of evidence A1]

---START CHUNK 1119---
In the first trial, the combination of mitomycin C, vindesine, and cisplatin were given concurrently with split-course daily radiation therapy to 56 Gy compared with chemotherapy followed by continuous daily radiation therapy to 56 Gy.[8]
Five-year overall survival (OS) rates favored concurrent therapy (27% vs. 9%).
Myelosuppression was greater among patients in the concurrent arm, but treatment-related mortality was less than 1% in both arms.[8]
In the second trial, 610 patients were randomly assigned to sequential chemotherapy with cisplatin and vinblastine followed by 63 Gy of radiation therapy, concurrent chemoradiation therapy using the same regimen, or concurrent chemotherapy with cisplatin and etoposide with twice-daily radiation therapy.[9,10]
Median and 5-year survival were superior in the concurrent chemotherapy with daily radiation therapy arm (17 months vs. 14.6 months and 16% vs. 10% for sequential regimen [P = .046]).

---START CHUNK 1125---
With improvement in radiation therapy–delivery technology in the 1990s, including tumor-motion management and image guidance, phase I/II trials demonstrated the feasibility of dose-escalation radiation therapy to 74 Gy with concurrent chemotherapy.[12-14] However, a phase III trial of a conventional dose of 60 Gy versus dose escalation to 74 Gy with concurrent weekly carboplatin/paclitaxel did not demonstrate improved local control or progression-free survival (PFS), and OS was worse with dose escalation (HR, 1.38 [1.09–1.76]; P = .004). There was a nonsignificant increase in grade 5 events with dose escalation (10% vs. 2%) and higher incidence of grade 3 esophagitis (21% vs. 7%; P = .0003).[15][Level of evidence A1]

---START CHUNK 1127---
Durvalumab is a selective human IgG1 monoclonal antibody that blocks programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) binding to programmed death 1 (PD-1) and CD80, allowing T cells to recognize and kill tumor cells.[16]
Evidence (durvalumab):
- The phase III PACIFIC trial (NCT02125461) enrolled 713 patients with stage III NSCLC whose disease had not progressed after two or more cycles of platinum-based chemoradiation therapy. Patients were randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to receive durvalumab (10 mg/kg intravenously) or placebo (every 2 weeks for up to 12 months).[16] The coprimary end points were PFS assessed by blinded independent central review and OS (unplanned for the interim analysis).
At the interim analysis, the coprimary end point of PFS was met. The median PFS was 16.8 months with durvalumab versus 5.6 months with placebo (HR, 0.52; 95% CI, 0.42–0.65; P < .001).[16][Level of evidence B1] The 18-month PFS rate was 44.2% with durvalumab versus 27% with placebo.

---START CHUNK 1128---
PFS benefit was seen across all prespecified subgroups and was irrespective of PD-L1 expression before chemoradiation therapy or smoking status. EGFR mutations were observed in 6% of patients (29 treated with durvalumab vs. 14 treated with placebo). The unstratified HR for the EGFR-mutated subgroup was 0.76 (95% CI, 0.35–1.64).
Grade 3 or 4 adverse events occurred in 29.9% of patients treated with durvalumab and in 26.1% of patients treated with placebo. The most common adverse event of grade 3 or 4 was pneumonia in 4.4% of patients treated with durvalumab and in 3.8% of patients treated with placebo.
OS was not assessed at the interim analysis.

---START CHUNK 1131---
Evidence (osimertinib following concurrent chemoradiation therapy):
- The phase III, double-blind, placebo-controlled LAURA trial (NCT03521154) included patients with unresectable EGFR-mutated stage III NSCLC who had not progressed during or after definitive chemoradiation therapy. A total of 216 patients who had undergone chemoradiation therapy were randomly assigned to receive either osimertinib (n = 143) or placebo (n = 73).The primary end point was PFS as assessed by blinded independent central review.[17]
The median PFS was 39.1 months with osimertinib and 5.6 months with placebo (HRdisease progression or death, 0.16; 95% CI, 0.10–0.24; P < .001).
At 36 months, the OS rate was 84% for patients in the osimertinib group (95% CI, 75%–89%) and 74% for patients in the placebo group (95% CI, 57%–85%) (HRdeath, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.42–1.56; P = .53) (at 20% data maturity).[17][Level of evidence A1]

---START CHUNK 1132---
Grade 3 or higher adverse events occurred in 35% of patients in the osimertinib group and 12% of patients in the placebo group. Radiation pneumonitis was reported in 48% of patients in the osimertinib group and 38% of patients in the placebo group.

Radiation therapy alone may provide benefit to patients with locally advanced unresectable stage III NSCLC.
Radiation therapy with traditional dose and fractionation schedules (1.8–2.0 Gy per fraction per day to 60–70 Gy in 6–7 weeks) results in reproducible long-term survival benefit in 5% to 10% of patients and significant palliation of symptoms.[22]
Evidence (radiation therapy for locally advanced unresectable tumor):
- One prospective randomized clinical study showed the following:
Radiation therapy given as three daily fractions improved OS compared with radiation therapy given as one daily fraction.[23][Level of evidence A1]
Patterns of failure for patients treated with radiation therapy alone included both locoregional and distant failures.

---START CHUNK 1139---
Radiation therapy may be effective in palliating symptomatic local involvement with NSCLC, such as:
- Tracheal, esophageal, or bronchial compression.
- Pain.
- Vocal cord paralysis.
- Hemoptysis.
- Superior vena cava syndrome.
In some cases, endobronchial laser therapy and/or brachytherapy has been used to alleviate proximal obstructing lesions.[24]
Evidence (radiation therapy for palliative treatment):
- A systematic review identified six randomized trials of high-dose rate endobronchial brachytherapy (HDREB) alone or with external-beam radiation therapy (EBRT) or laser therapy.[25]
Better overall symptom palliation and fewer re-treatments were required in previously untreated patients using EBRT alone.[25][Level of evidence A3]
HDREB provided palliation of symptomatic patients with recurrent endobronchial obstruction previously treated by EBRT, when it was technically feasible.

---START CHUNK 1140---
HDREB provided palliation of symptomatic patients with recurrent endobronchial obstruction previously treated by EBRT, when it was technically feasible.
Although EBRT is frequently prescribed for symptom palliation, there is no consensus about when the fractionation scheme should be used.
Although different multifraction regimens appear to provide similar symptom relief,[26-31] single-fraction radiation may be insufficient for symptom relief compared with hypofractionated or standard regimens, as shown in the National Cancer Institute of Canada Clinical Trials Group trial (NCT00003685).[28][Level of evidence A3]
Evidence of a modest increase in survival in patients with better performance status given high-dose radiation therapy is available.[26,27][Level of evidence A1]

Forty percent of patients with newly diagnosed non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) have stage IV disease. Treatment goals are to prolong survival and control disease-related symptoms. Treatment options include cytotoxic chemotherapy, targeted agents, and immunotherapy. Factors influencing treatment selection include comorbidity, performance status, histology, and molecular and immunologic features of the cancer. Therefore, assessment of tumor-genomic changes and programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression is critical before initiating therapy. Radiation therapy and surgery are generally used in selective cases for symptom palliation.
Factors that affect selection of treatment include:
- History and molecular features.
- Age and comorbidity.
- Performance status.

Patients with nonsquamous cell histology, good performance status, no history of hemoptysis or other bleeding, or recent history of cardiovascular events may benefit from the addition of bevacizumab to paclitaxel and carboplatin. Patients with tumors harboring sensitizing mutations in exons 19 or 21 of EGFR, particularly those from East Asia, never smokers, and those with adenocarcinoma may benefit from epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) as an alternative to first- or second-line chemotherapy. Patients with tumors harboring ALK translocations, ROS1 rearrangements, or NTRK fusions may benefit from anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK), ROS1, or neurotrophic tyrosine kinase (NTRK) inhibitors as an alternative to first- or second-line chemotherapy.

---START CHUNK 1162---
Patients with tumors expressing PD-L1 (>50% by immunohistochemistry) have improved survival with pembrolizumab. The addition of pembrolizumab to carboplatin-plus-pemetrexed chemotherapy for nonsquamous advanced lung cancer improves survival irrespective of PD-L1 expression.[1][Level of evidence A1] For patients with stage IV or recurrent NSCLC and PD-L1 expression on at least 1% of tumor cells, frontline combination immunotherapy with nivolumab and ipilimumab increases overall survival (OS).[2][Level of evidence A1] Second-line systemic therapy with nivolumab, docetaxel, pemetrexed, or pembrolizumab for PD-L1−positive tumors also improves survival in patients with good performance status (who have not received the same or a similar agent in the first-line setting).[3][Level of evidence A1]
The role of systemic therapy in patients with an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status below 2 is less certain.

Patients with adenocarcinoma may benefit from pemetrexed [4] and bevacizumab, as well as from combination chemotherapy with pembrolizumab. Patients with unresectable, locally advanced or metastatic, well-differentiated, nonfunctional, neuroendocrine tumors benefit from the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitor, everolimus.

---START CHUNK 1165---
Evidence supports the concept that older patients with good performance status and limited comorbidity may benefit from combination chemotherapy. Age alone should not dictate treatment-related decisions in patients with advanced NSCLC. Older patients with a good performance status enjoy longer survival and a better quality of life when treated with chemotherapy compared with supportive care alone. Caution should be exercised when extrapolating data for patients aged 70 to 79 years to patients aged 80 years or older because only a very small number of patients aged 80 years or older have been enrolled in clinical trials, and the benefit in this group is uncertain.[5,6]
Evidence (age and comorbidity):

---START CHUNK 1166---
Evidence (age and comorbidity):
- Platinum-containing combination chemotherapy regimens provide clinical benefit when compared with supportive care or single-agent therapy; however, such treatment may be contraindicated in some older patients because of the age-related reduction in the functional reserve of many organs and/or comorbid conditions. Approximately two-thirds of patients with NSCLC are aged 65 years or older, and approximately 40% are aged 70 years or older.[7] Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program data suggest that the percentage of patients older than 70 years is closer to 50%.

---START CHUNK 1167---
- A review of the SEER Medicare data from 1994 to 1999 found a much lower rate of chemotherapy use than expected for the overall population.[8] The same data suggested that older patients may have more comorbidities or a higher rate of functional compromise that would make study participation difficult, if not contraindicated; lack of clinical trial data may influence decisions to treat individual patients with standard chemotherapy.
- Single-agent chemotherapy and combination chemotherapy clearly benefit at least some older patients. In the Elderly Lung Cancer Vinorelbine Italian Study, 154 patients who were older than 70 years were randomly assigned to vinorelbine or supportive care.[9]
Patients who were treated with vinorelbine had a 1-year survival rate of 32%, compared with 14% for those who were treated with supportive care alone. Quality-of-life parameters were also significantly improved in the chemotherapy arm, and toxic effects were acceptable.

- Patients who were treated with vinorelbine had a 1-year survival rate of 32%, compared with 14% for those who were treated with supportive care alone. Quality-of-life parameters were also significantly improved in the chemotherapy arm, and toxic effects were acceptable.
- A trial from Japan compared single-agent docetaxel with vinorelbine in 180 patients older than 70 years with good performance status.[10]
Response rates (22% vs. 10%) and progression-free survival (PFS) (5.4 months vs. 3.1 months) were significantly better with docetaxel, but median survival (14.3 months vs. 9.9 months) and 1-year survival rates (59% vs. 37%) did not reach statistical significance.
- Response rates (22% vs. 10%) and progression-free survival (PFS) (5.4 months vs. 3.1 months) were significantly better with docetaxel, but median survival (14.3 months vs. 9.9 months) and 1-year survival rates (59% vs. 37%) did not reach statistical significance.

---START CHUNK 1169---
- Retrospective data analyzing and comparing younger (age <70 years) patients with older (age ≥70 years) patients who participated in large randomized trials of doublet combinations have also shown that older patients may derive the same survival benefit, but with a higher risk of toxic effects in the bone marrow.[5,6,11-14]

Section: Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Treatment (PDQ®)–Health Professional Version > Treatment of Newly Diagnosed Stage IV, Relapsed, and Recurrent NSCLC > Factors Affecting Treatment Selection > Performance status

---START CHUNK 1171---
Performance status is among the most important prognostic factors for survival of patients with NSCLC.[15] The benefit of therapy for this group of patients has been evaluated through retrospective analyses and prospective clinical trials.
The results support further evaluation of chemotherapeutic approaches for both metastatic and locally advanced NSCLC; however, the efficacy of current platinum-based chemotherapy combinations is such that no specific regimen can be regarded as standard therapy. Outside of a clinical trial setting, chemotherapy should only be given to patients with good performance status and evaluable tumor lesions, who desire this treatment after being fully informed of its anticipated risks and limited benefits.
Randomized controlled trials of patients with stage IV disease and good performance status have shown that cisplatin-based chemotherapy improves survival and palliates disease-related symptoms.[3][Level of evidence A1]
Evidence (performance status):

---START CHUNK 1172---
Evidence (performance status):
- The Cancer and Leukemia Group B trial (CLB-9730 [NCT00003117]), which compared carboplatin and paclitaxel with single-agent paclitaxel, enrolled 99 patients with a performance status of 2 (18% of the study's population).[13]
When compared with patients with a performance status of 0 to 1, who had a median survival of 8.8 months and a 1-year survival rate of 38%, the corresponding median survival figures for patients with a performance status of 2 were 3.0 months and a 1-year survival rate of 14%; this demonstrates the poor prognosis conferred by a lower performance status. These differences were statistically significant.

---START CHUNK 1173---
When patients with a performance status of 2 were analyzed by treatment arm, those who received combination chemotherapy had a significantly higher response rate (24% vs. 10%), longer median survival (4.7 months vs. 2.4 months), and a superior 1-year survival rate (18% vs. 10%), compared with those who were treated with single-agent paclitaxel.[13]

- A phase III trial compared single-agent pemetrexed with the combination of carboplatin and pemetrexed in 205 patients with a performance status of 2 who had not had any previous chemotherapy.[16][Level of evidence A1]
Median OS was 5.3 months for the pemetrexed-alone group and 9.3 months for the carboplatin-and-pemetrexed group (hazard ratio [HR], 0.62; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.46–0.83; P = .001).
Median PFS was 2.8 months for the pemetrexed-alone group and 5.8 months for the carboplatin-and-pemetrexed group (P < .001).

---START CHUNK 1175---
Median PFS was 2.8 months for the pemetrexed-alone group and 5.8 months for the carboplatin-and-pemetrexed group (P < .001).

Side effects were more frequent in the combination arm, as expected.
This study, which was performed in eight centers in Brazil and one center in the United States, reported rates of OS and PFS that were higher than has historically been noted in most, although not all, other published studies. This may indicate differences in patient selection.

---START CHUNK 1187---
The type and number of chemotherapy drugs to be used for the treatment of patients with advanced NSCLC has been extensively evaluated in randomized controlled trials and meta-analyses.
Several randomized trials have evaluated various drugs combined with either cisplatin or carboplatin in previously untreated patients with advanced NSCLC. On the basis of meta-analyses of the trials, the following conclusions can be drawn:
- Certain three-drug combinations that add so-called targeted agents may result in superior survival.
- EGFR inhibitors may benefit selected patients with EGFR mutations.
- Maintenance chemotherapy after four cycles of platinum combination chemotherapy may improve PFS and OS.

---START CHUNK 1188---
- EGFR inhibitors may benefit selected patients with EGFR mutations.
- Maintenance chemotherapy after four cycles of platinum combination chemotherapy may improve PFS and OS.
- Platinum combinations with vinorelbine, paclitaxel, docetaxel, gemcitabine, irinotecan, protein-bound paclitaxel, and pemetrexed yield similar improvements in survival. Types and frequencies of toxic effects differ, and these may determine the preferred regimen for an individual patient. Patients with adenocarcinoma may benefit from pemetrexed.
- Cisplatin and carboplatin yield similar improvements in outcome with different toxic effects. Some, but not all, trials and meta-analyses of trials suggest that outcomes with cisplatin may be superior, although with a higher risk of certain toxicities such as nausea and vomiting.
- Nonplatinum combinations offer no advantage to platinum-based chemotherapy, and some studies demonstrate inferiority.

Evidence (combination chemotherapy):
- The Cochrane Collaboration reviewed data from all randomized controlled trials published between January 1980 and June 2006, comparing a doublet regimen with a single-agent regimen or comparing a triplet regimen with a doublet regimen in patients with advanced NSCLC.[24] Sixty-five trials (13,601 patients) were identified.

---START CHUNK 1190---
In the trials that compared a doublet regimen with a single-agent regimen, a significant increase was observed in tumor response (odds ratio [OR], 0.42; 95% CI, 0.37–0.47; P < .001) and 1-year survival (OR, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.70–0.91; P < .001) in favor of the doublet regimen. The absolute benefit in 1-year survival was 5%, which corresponds to an increase in 1-year survival from 30% with a single-agent regimen to 35% with a doublet regimen. The rates of grades 3 and 4 toxic effects caused by doublet regimens were statistically increased compared with rates after single-agent therapy, with ORs ranging from 1.2 to 6.2. Infection rates did not increase in doublet regimens.
There was no increase in 1-year survival (OR, 1.01; 95% CI, 0.85–1.21; P = .88) for triplet regimens versus doublet regimens. The median survival ratio was 1.00 (95% CI, 0.94–1.06; P = .97).

The absolute benefit in 1-year survival was 5%, which corresponds to an increase in 1-year survival from 30% with a single-agent regimen to 35% with a doublet regimen. The rates of grades 3 and 4 toxic effects caused by doublet regimens were statistically increased compared with rates after single-agent therapy, with ORs ranging from 1.2 to 6.2.

- There was no increase in 1-year survival (OR, 1.01; 95% CI, 0.85–1.21; P = .88) for triplet regimens versus doublet regimens. The median survival ratio was 1.00 (95% CI, 0.94–1.06; P = .97).
- Several meta-analyses have evaluated whether cisplatin or carboplatin regimens are superior, with variable results.[25-27] One meta-analysis reported individual patient data for 2,968 patients entered in nine randomized trials.[25]
The objective response rate was higher for patients treated with cisplatin (30%) than for patients treated with carboplatin (24%); (OR, 1.37; 95% CI, 1.16–1.61; P < .001).
Carboplatin treatment was associated with a nonstatistically significant increase in the hazard of mortality relative to treatment with cisplatin (HR, 1.07; 95% CI, 0.99–1.15; P = .100).

---START CHUNK 1193---
Carboplatin treatment was associated with a nonstatistically significant increase in the hazard of mortality relative to treatment with cisplatin (HR, 1.07; 95% CI, 0.99–1.15; P = .100).
In patients with nonsquamous cell tumors and in patients treated with third-generation chemotherapy, carboplatin-based chemotherapy was associated with a statistically significant increase in mortality (HR, 1.12; 95% CI, 1.01–1.23 in patients with nonsquamous cell tumors and HR, 1.11; 95% CI, 1.01–1.21 in patients treated with third-generation chemotherapy).
Treatment-related toxic effects were also assessed in the meta-analysis. More thrombocytopenia was seen with carboplatin than with cisplatin (12% vs. 6%; OR, 2.27; 95% CI, 1.71–3.01; P < .001), but cisplatin caused more nausea and vomiting (8% vs. 18%; OR, 0.42; 95% CI, 0.33–0.53; P < .001) and renal toxic effects (0.5% vs. 1.5%; OR, 0.37; 95% CI, 0.15–0.88; P = .018).

---START CHUNK 1194---
The authors concluded that treatment with cisplatin was not associated with a substantial increase in the overall risk of severe toxic effects. This comprehensive individual-patient meta-analysis is consistent with the conclusions of other meta-analyses that were based on essentially the same clinical trials, but which used only published data.

- Three literature-based meta-analyses have trials that compared platinum with nonplatinum combinations.[28-30]
The first meta-analysis identified 37 assessable trials that included 7,633 patients.[28]
A 62% increase in the OR for response was attributable to platinum-based therapy (OR, 1.62; 95% CI, 1.46–1.8; P < .001). The 1-year survival rate was increased by 5% with platinum-based regimens (34% vs. 29%; OR, 1.21; 95% CI, 1.09–1.35; P = .003).
No statistically significant increase in 1-year survival was found when platinum therapies were compared with third-generation-based combination regimens (OR, 1.11; 95% CI, 0.96–1.28; P = .17).

No statistically significant increase in 1-year survival was found when platinum therapies were compared with third-generation-based combination regimens (OR, 1.11; 95% CI, 0.96–1.28; P = .17).
The toxic effects of platinum-based regimens was significantly higher for hematologic toxic effects, nephrotoxic effects, and nausea and vomiting but not for neurological toxic effects, febrile neutropenia rate, or toxic death rate. These results are consistent with the second literature-based meta-analysis.
The second meta-analysis identified 17 trials that included 4,920 patients.[29]
The use of platinum-based doublet regimens was associated with a slightly higher survival at 1 year (relative risk [RR], 1.08; 95% CI, 1.01%–1.16%; P = .03) and a better partial response (RR, 1.11; 95% CI, 1.02–1.21; P = .02), with a higher risk of anemia, nausea, and neurological toxic effects.

---START CHUNK 1198---
In subanalyses, cisplatin-based doublet regimens improved survival at 1 year (RR, 1.16%; 95% CI, 1.06–1.27; P = .001), complete response (RR, 2.29; 95% CI, 1.08–4.88; P = .03), and partial response (RR, 1.19; 95% CI, 1.07–1.32; P = .002), with an increased risk of anemia, neutropenia, neurological toxic effects, and nausea.
Conversely, carboplatin-based doublet regimens did not increase survival at 1 year (RR, 0.95; 95% CI, 0.85–1.07; P = .43).
The third meta-analysis of phase III trials randomizing platinum-based versus nonplatinum combinations as first-line chemotherapy identified 14 trials.[30] Experimental arms were gemcitabine and vinorelbine (n = 4), gemcitabine and taxane (n = 7), gemcitabine and epirubicin (n = 1), paclitaxel and vinorelbine (n = 1), and gemcitabine and ifosfamide (n = 1). This meta-analysis was limited to the set of 11 phase III studies that used a platinum-based doublet (2,298 patients in the platinum-based arm and 2,304 patients in the nonplatinum arm).

---START CHUNK 1199---
Patients treated with a platinum-based regimen benefited from a statistically significant reduction in the risk of death at 1 year (OR, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.78–0.99; P = .044) and a lower risk of being refractory to chemotherapy (OR, 0.87; CI, 0.73–0.99; P = .049).
Forty-four (1.9%) toxic-related deaths were reported for platinum-based regimens and 29 (1.3%) toxic-related deaths were reported for nonplatinum regimens (OR, 1.53; CI, 0.96–2.49; P = .08). An increased risk of grade 3 to 4 gastrointestinal and hematologic toxic effects for patients treated with platinum-based chemotherapy was statistically demonstrated. There was no statistically significant increase in the risk of febrile neutropenia (OR, 1.23; CI, 0.94–1.60; P = .063).

A 62% increase in the OR for response was attributable to platinum-based therapy (OR, 1.62; 95% CI, 1.46–1.8; P < .001). The 1-year survival rate was increased by 5% with platinum-based regimens (34% vs. 29%; OR, 1.21; 95% CI, 1.09–1.35; P = .003).
No statistically significant increase in 1-year survival was found when platinum therapies were compared with third-generation-based combination regimens (OR, 1.11; 95% CI, 0.96–1.28; P = .17).
The toxic effects of platinum-based regimens was significantly higher for hematologic toxic effects, nephrotoxic effects, and nausea and vomiting but not for neurological toxic effects, febrile neutropenia rate, or toxic death rate.

---START CHUNK 1208---
Among the active combinations, definitive recommendations regarding drug dose and schedule cannot be made, except for carboplatin, pemetrexed, and pembrolizumab for patients with nonsquamous tumor histology.
Evidence (drug and dose schedule):
- One meta-analysis of seven trials that included 2,867 patients assessed the benefit of docetaxel versus vinorelbine.[31] Docetaxel was administered with a platinum agent in three trials, with gemcitabine in two trials, or as monotherapy in two trials. Vinca alkaloid (vinorelbine in six trials and vindesine in one trial) was administered with cisplatin in six trials or alone in one trial.
The pooled estimate for OS showed an 11% improvement in favor of docetaxel (HR, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.82–0.96; P = .004). Sensitivity analyses that considered only vinorelbine as a comparator or only the doublet regimens showed similar improvements.

---START CHUNK 1209---
Grade 3 to 4 neutropenia and grade 3 to 4 serious adverse events were less frequent with docetaxel-based regimens (OR, 0.59; 95% CI, 0.38–0.89; P = .013) versus vinca alkaloid-based regimens (OR, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.55–0.84; P < .001).

---START CHUNK 1210---
- Two randomized trials compared weekly versus every-3-week dosing of paclitaxel and carboplatin, which reported no significant difference in efficacy and better tolerability for weekly administration.[32,33] Although meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials suggest that cisplatin combinations may be superior to carboplatin or nonplatinum combinations, the clinical relevance of the differences in efficacy must be balanced against the anticipated tolerability, logistics of administration, and familiarity of the medical staff in making treatment decisions for individual patients.
- A large, noninferiority, phase III randomized study compared the OS in 1,725 chemotherapy-naïve patients with stage IIIB/IV NSCLC and a performance status of 0 to 1.[4] Patients received cisplatin 75 mg/m2 on day 1 and gemcitabine 1,250 mg/m2 on days 1 and 8 (n = 863) or cisplatin 75 mg/m2 and pemetrexed 500 mg/m2 on day 1 (n = 862) every 3 weeks for up to six cycles.

---START CHUNK 1211---
OS for cisplatin and pemetrexed (median survival, 10.3 months) was noninferior to cisplatin and gemcitabine (median survival, 10.3 months; HR, 0.94; 95% CI, 0.84%–1.05%).
In patients with adenocarcinoma (n = 847), OS was statistically superior for cisplatin and pemetrexed (12.6 months) versus cisplatin and gemcitabine (10.9 months); in patients with large cell carcinoma (n = 153), OS was statistically superior for cisplatin and pemetrexed (10.4 months) versus cisplatin and gemcitabine (6.7 months).
In contrast, in patients with squamous cell histology (n = 473), there was a significant improvement in survival with cisplatin and gemcitabine (10.8 months) versus cisplatin and pemetrexed (9.4 months). For cisplatin and pemetrexed, rates of grade 3 or 4 neutropenia, anemia, and thrombocytopenia (P ≤ .001); febrile neutropenia (P = .002); and alopecia (P < .001) were significantly lower, whereas grade 3 or 4 nausea (P = .004) was more common.

---START CHUNK 1212---
The results of this study suggested that the cisplatin and pemetrexed doublet is another alternative doublet for first-line chemotherapy for advanced NSCLC. The results also suggested that there may be differences in outcome depending on histology.

---START CHUNK 1215---
Evidence (bevacizumab):
- Two randomized trials have evaluated the addition of bevacizumab, an antibody targeting vascular endothelial growth factor, to standard first-line combination chemotherapy.
In a randomized study of 878 patients with recurrent or advanced stage IIIB/IV NSCLC, 444 patients received paclitaxel and carboplatin alone, and 434 patients received paclitaxel and carboplatin plus bevacizumab.[34] Chemotherapy was administered every 3 weeks for six cycles, and bevacizumab was administered every 3 weeks until disease progression was evident or toxic effects were intolerable. Patients with squamous cell tumors, brain metastases, clinically significant hemoptysis, or inadequate organ function or performance status (ECOG performance status >1) were excluded.
Median survival was 12.3 months in the group assigned to chemotherapy plus bevacizumab, as compared with 10.3 months in the chemotherapy-alone group (HRdeath, 0.79; P = .003).

---START CHUNK 1216---
Median survival was 12.3 months in the group assigned to chemotherapy plus bevacizumab, as compared with 10.3 months in the chemotherapy-alone group (HRdeath, 0.79; P = .003).
Median PFS was 6.2 months in the group assigned to chemotherapy plus bevacizumab (HRdisease progression, 0.66; P < .001), with a 35% response rate (P < .001), and 4.5 months in the chemotherapy-alone group (HRdisease progression, 0.66; P < .001), with a 15% response rate (P < .001).
Rates of clinically significant bleeding were 4.4% in the group assigned to chemotherapy plus bevacizumab and 0.7% in the chemotherapy-alone group (P < .001). There were 15 treatment-related deaths in the chemotherapy-plus-bevacizumab group, including five from pulmonary hemorrhage.
For this subgroup of patients with NSCLC, the addition of bevacizumab to paclitaxel and carboplatin may provide survival benefit.[34][Level of evidence A1]

Another randomized, phase III trial investigated the efficacy and safety of cisplatin-gemcitabine plus bevacizumab.[35] Patients were randomly assigned to receive cisplatin (80 mg/m2) and gemcitabine (1,250 mg/m2) for up to six cycles, plus low-dose bevacizumab (7.5 mg/kg), high-dose bevacizumab (15 mg/kg), or placebo every 3 weeks until disease progression. The primary end point was amended from OS to PFS during the course of the study. A total of 1,043 patients were accrued (placebo group, n = 347; low-dose group, n = 345; high-dose group, n = 351).

---START CHUNK 1218---
PFS was significantly prolonged with the addition of bevacizumab; the HRs for PFS were 0.75 in the low-dose group (median PFS, 6.7 months vs. 6.1 months for the placebo group; P = .03) and 0.82 in the high-dose group compared with the placebo group (median PFS, 6.5 months vs. 6.1 months for the placebo group; P = .03).[35][Level of evidence A1]
Objective response rates were also improved with the addition of bevacizumab, and they were 20.1% for placebo, 34.1% for low-dose bevacizumab, and 30.4% for high-dose bevacizumab plus cisplatin/gemcitabine.
Incidence of grade 3 or greater adverse events was similar across arms.
Grade 3 or greater pulmonary hemorrhage rates were 1.5% or less for all arms, despite 9% of patients receiving therapeutic anticoagulation.
These results support the addition of bevacizumab to platinum-containing chemotherapy, but the results are far less impressive than when the carboplatin-paclitaxel combination was used.

---START CHUNK 1227---
Evidence (cetuximab):
- Two trials have evaluated the addition of cetuximab to first-line combination chemotherapy.[36,37]
In the first trial, 676 chemotherapy-naïve patients with stage IIIB (pleural effusion) or stage IV NSCLC, without restrictions by histology or EGFR expression, received cetuximab with taxane (paclitaxel or docetaxel with carboplatin) or combination chemotherapy.[36]
The addition of cetuximab did not result in a statistically significant improvement in PFS, the primary study end point, or OS.
Median PFS was 4.40 months for patients in the cetuximab-chemotherapy arm versus 4.24 months for patients in the taxane-carboplatin arm (HR, 0.902; 95% CI, 0.761–1.069; P = .236).
Median OS was 9.69 months for patients in the cetuximab-chemotherapy arm versus 8.38 months for patients in the chemotherapy-alone arm (HR, 0.890; 95% CI, 0.754–1.051; P = .169).

---START CHUNK 1228---
Median OS was 9.69 months for patients in the cetuximab-chemotherapy arm versus 8.38 months for patients in the chemotherapy-alone arm (HR, 0.890; 95% CI, 0.754–1.051; P = .169).
No significant associations were found between EGFR expression, EGFR mutation, EGFR copy number, or KRAS mutations and PFS, OS, and response in the treatment-specific analyses.[38]
The second trial was composed of 1,125 chemotherapy-naïve patients with advanced EGFR-expressing stage IIIB/IV NSCLC treated with cisplatin-vinorelbine chemotherapy plus cetuximab or chemotherapy alone.[37]
The primary study end point, OS, was longer for patients treated with cetuximab and chemotherapy (median 11.3 months vs. 10.1 months; HRdeath, 0.871; 95% CI, 0.762–0.996; P = .044).
A survival benefit was seen in all histological subgroups; however, survival benefit was not seen in non-White or Asian patients. Only the interaction between the treatment and the ethnic origin was significant (P = .011).

---START CHUNK 1229---

It is not clear whether the differences in outcome in these two studies are the result of differences in the study populations, tumor characterization for EGFR expression, or chemotherapy regimens.
- In the first trial, 676 chemotherapy-naïve patients with stage IIIB (pleural effusion) or stage IV NSCLC, without restrictions by histology or EGFR expression, received cetuximab with taxane (paclitaxel or docetaxel with carboplatin) or combination chemotherapy.[36]
The addition of cetuximab did not result in a statistically significant improvement in PFS, the primary study end point, or OS.
Median PFS was 4.40 months for patients in the cetuximab-chemotherapy arm versus 4.24 months for patients in the taxane-carboplatin arm (HR, 0.902; 95% CI, 0.761–1.069; P = .236).

The SQUIRE trial (NCT00981058) randomly assigned 1,093 patients with advanced squamous NSCLC to receive either first-line chemotherapy with cisplatin and gemcitabine or the same regimen with the addition of necitumumab (800 mg on day 1 and day 8 of each cycle).[40]
Median OS was prolonged with the addition of necitumumab (11.5 months vs. 9.9 months; P = .01).
PFS was also prolonged with the addition of necitumumab (5.7 months vs. 5.5 months); however, the overall response rate was similar in both groups (31% vs. 28%).
Grades 3 and 4 adverse events were higher in the necitumumab-containing arm (72% vs. 62%).

Section: Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Treatment (PDQ®)–Health Professional Version > Treatment of Newly Diagnosed Stage IV, Relapsed, and Recurrent NSCLC > Treatment Options for Newly Diagnosed Stage IV, Relapsed, and Recurrent NSCLC (First-Line Therapy) > Maintenance therapy after first-line chemotherapy (for patients with stable or responding disease after four cycles of platinum-based combination chemotherapy)

---START CHUNK 1243---
One extensively investigated treatment strategy in NSCLC is maintenance therapy after initial response to chemotherapy. Options for maintenance therapy that have been investigated include:
- Continuing the initial combination chemotherapy regimen.
- Continuing only single-agent chemotherapy.
- Introducing a new agent as maintenance.
Multiple randomized trials have evaluated the efficacy of continuing first-line combination cytotoxic chemotherapy beyond three to four cycles.
Evidence (maintenance therapy following first-line chemotherapy):
- None of the trials of continued cytotoxic combinations showed a significant OS advantage with additional or longer durations beyond four cycles. For patients with nonsquamous NSCLC, two studies have demonstrated improved PFS and OS with either switch or continuous maintenance chemotherapy (e.g., maintenance pemetrexed after initial cisplatin and gemcitabine or maintenance pemetrexed after initial cisplatin and pemetrexed).[41]

---START CHUNK 1244---
- Three trials found statistically significantly improved PFS or time to progression with additional chemotherapy.[42-44]
- No consistent improvement in quality of life was reported.[43,45,46]
- Chemotherapy-related toxicities were greater with prolonged chemotherapy.[45,46]

---START CHUNK 1245---
These data suggest that PFS and OS for patients with nonsquamous NSCLC may be improved either by continuing an effective chemotherapy beyond four cycles or by immediate initiation of alternative chemotherapy. The improvement in PFS, however, is tempered by an increase in adverse events including additional cytotoxic chemotherapy and no consistent improvement in quality of life. For patients who have stable disease or who respond to first-line therapy, evidence does not support the continuation of combination cytotoxic chemotherapy until disease progression or the initiation of a different chemotherapy before disease progression. Collectively, these trials suggest that first-line cytotoxic combination chemotherapy should be stopped at disease progression or after four cycles in patients whose disease is not responding to treatment; it can be administered for no more than six cycles.[42,43,45,46] For patients with nonsquamous NSCLC who have a response or stable disease after four to six

disease is not responding to treatment; it can be administered for no more than six cycles.[42,43,45,46] For patients with nonsquamous NSCLC who have a response or stable disease after four to six cycles of platinum combination chemotherapy, maintenance chemotherapy with pemetrexed should be considered.[41]

---START CHUNK 1247---
Evidence (first-line platinum-based combination chemotherapy followed by pemetrexed):
The findings of two randomized trials (NCT00102804 and NCT00789373) have shown improved outcomes with the addition of pemetrexed after standard first-line platinum-based combination chemotherapy.[44,47]
- In the first trial, 663 patients with stage IIIB/IV disease who had not progressed on four cycles of nonpemetrexed platinum–based chemotherapy were randomly assigned (in a 2:1 ratio) to receive pemetrexed or placebo until disease progression.[47]
Both the primary end point of PFS and the secondary end point of OS were statistically significantly prolonged with the addition of maintenance pemetrexed (median PFS, 4.3 months vs. 2.6 months; HR, 0.50; 95% CI, 0.42–0.61; P < .0001; median OS, 13.4 months vs. 10.6 months; HR, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.65–0.95; P = .012).
Benefit was not seen in patients with squamous histology.

Benefit was not seen in patients with squamous histology.
Higher than grade 3 toxicity and treatment discontinuations that resulted from drug-related toxic effects were higher in the pemetrexed group than in the placebo group.
No pemetrexed-related deaths occurred.
Relatively fewer patients in the pemetrexed group than in the placebo group received systemic postdiscontinuation therapy (227 [51%] vs. 149 [67%]; P = .0001).
Quality of life during maintenance therapy with pemetrexed was similar to placebo, except for a small increase in loss of appetite and significantly delayed worsening of pain and hemoptysis as assessed using the Lung Cancer Symptom Scale.[48] The quality-of-life results require cautious evaluation because there was a high degree of censoring (>50%) with the primary quality-of-life end point, which was time to worsening of symptoms.

Evidence (osimertinib alone):
- A phase III, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, controlled trial (FLAURA [NCT02296125]) compared osimertinib, an oral, third-generation, irreversible EGFR TKI that inhibits both EGFR-TKI–sensitizing mutations and the EGFR T790M resistance mutation, with standard of care EGFR TKIs (gefitinib or erlotinib) as first-line treatment of patients with previously untreated, EGFR mutation-positive (exon 19 deletion or L858R), advanced NSCLC, as detected by a U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved test.[49] The 556 patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio.

The median duration of response (DOR) was 17.2 months (95% CI, 13.8–22.0) with osimertinib versus 8.5 months (95% CI, 7.3–9.8) with standard EGFR TKIs.
OS was a key secondary end point.

The crossover rate from the standard EGFR TKI group to the osimertinib group was 31% (85 of 277) among patients assigned to the standard EGFR TKI group and 47% (85 of 180) among patients discontinuing the EGFR TKI. The authors noted that this crossover probably contributed to the duration of OS in the EGFR TKI (31.8 months).
No new safety signals were observed. Rates of adverse events of grade 3 or higher and adverse events leading treatment discontinuations were similar between groups.

Evidence (osimertinib plus chemotherapy):
- A multicenter, randomized, open-label, phase III trial (FLAURA2 [NCT04035486]) compared osimertinib plus chemotherapy with osimertinib alone in patients with EGFR-mutated (exon 19 deletion or L858R mutation) advanced NSCLC who had not previously received treatment for advanced disease. Patients received osimertinib (80 mg once daily) with chemotherapy (pemetrexed [500 mg/m2 of body-surface area] plus either cisplatin [75 mg/m2] or carboplatin [pharmacologically guided dose, area under the curve (AUC) = 5]) or osimertinib monotherapy (80 mg once daily). Chemotherapy in the combination arm was given for four 21-day cycles and was followed by osimertinib and pemetrexed (500 mg/m2) maintenance every 3 weeks. A total of 557 eligible patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio. The primary end point was investigator-assessed PFS.[51]

---START CHUNK 1263---
PFS was 25.5 months (24.7–not calculable) for patients in the osimertinib-plus-chemotherapy group and 16.7 months (14.1–21.3) for patients in the osimertinib-monotherapy group (HR, 0.62; 95% CI, 0.49–0.79; P < .001).[51][Level of evidence B1] PFS was assessed according to blinded independent central review and was consistent with the primary analysis (HR, 0.62; 95% CI, 0.48–0.80).
At 24 months, 57% (95% CI, 50%–63%) of the patients in the osimertinib-plus-chemotherapy group and 41% (95% CI, 35%–47%) of those in the osimertinib-alone group were alive and progression-free.
An objective response (complete or partial) occurred in 83% of patients who received osimertinib plus chemotherapy and 76% of patients who received osimertinib alone.
The median DOR was 24.0 months (95% CI, 20.9–27.8) in the osimertinib-plus-chemotherapy group and 15.3 months (95% CI, 12.7–19.4), in the osimertinib-alone group.

Grade 3 or higher adverse events from any cause were more common with the combination (64%) than with monotherapy (27%); this is consistent with known chemotherapy-related adverse events.

- At 24 months, 57% (95% CI, 50%–63%) of the patients in the osimertinib-plus-chemotherapy group and 41% (95% CI, 35%–47%) of those in the osimertinib-alone group were alive and progression-free.
- An objective response (complete or partial) occurred in 83% of patients who received osimertinib plus chemotherapy and 76% of patients who received osimertinib alone.
- The median DOR was 24.0 months (95% CI, 20.9–27.8) in the osimertinib-plus-chemotherapy group and 15.3 months (95% CI, 12.7–19.4), in the osimertinib-alone group.
- Grade 3 or higher adverse events from any cause were more common with the combination (64%) than with monotherapy (27%); this is consistent with known chemotherapy-related adverse events. Osimertinib plus pemetrexed with a platinum-based agent had a safety profile that was consistent with the established profiles of these agents.
Analysis of OS, a secondary end point, requires further follow-up (data maturity, 27%).

---START CHUNK 1267---
Evidence (dacomitinib):
- A multicenter, randomized, open-label, phase III trial (ARCHER 1050 [NCT01774721]) compared dacomitinib, a second-generation, irreversible EGFR TKI, administered orally at a dose of 45 mg per day with gefitinib administered orally at a dose of 250 mg per day, as first-line therapy in patients with newly diagnosed advanced NSCLC harboring the following EGFR mutations: exon 19 deletion or exon 21 L858R substitution mutations, as detected by an FDA-approved test.[52] Four hundred and fifty-two eligible patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio. The primary end point was PFS assessed by masked independent review in the intention-to-treat (ITT) population.
Median PFS was 14.7 months in the dacomitinib group and 9.2 months in the gefitinib group (HR, 0.59; 95% CI, 0.47−0.74; P < .0001).[52][Level of evidence B1]

Grade 3 or higher adverse events of any cause occurred in 63% of patients who received dacomitinib and 41% of patients who received gefitinib. The most common grade 3 or 4 adverse events were dermatitis acneiform (14% in the dacomitinib group vs. none in the gefitinib group), diarrhea (8% vs. 1%), and raised alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels (1% vs. 8%). Serious treatment-related adverse events were more frequent in the dacomitinib group (9% vs. 4%). Permanent discontinuation of the study drug because of treatment-related adverse events occurred more often in the dacomitinib group (10% vs. 7%). Dose reductions were also more frequent in the dacomitinib group (66% vs. 8%).

Evidence (gefitinib):
- A phase III, multicenter, randomized trial compared gefitinib with carboplatin plus paclitaxel as first-line treatment in clinically selected patients in East Asia who had advanced adenocarcinoma of the lung and had never smoked or were former light smokers.[53]
The study met its primary objective of demonstrating the superiority of gefitinib compared with the carboplatin-paclitaxel combination for PFS (HRprogression or death, 0.74; 95% CI, 0.65–0.85; P < .001).
The median PFS was 5.7 months in the gefitinib group and 5.8 months in the carboplatin-paclitaxel group.[53][Level of evidence B1]
Following the time that chemotherapy was discontinued and while gefitinib was continued, the PFS curves clearly separated and favored gefitinib.
The 12-month PFS rates were 24.9% with the gefitinib group and 6.7% with the carboplatin-paclitaxel group.

---START CHUNK 1275---
The 12-month PFS rates were 24.9% with the gefitinib group and 6.7% with the carboplatin-paclitaxel group.
More than 90% of the patients in the trial with mutations had either del19 or exon 21 L858R mutations, which have been shown to be sensitive to EGFR inhibitors. In the subgroup of patients with a mutation, PFS was significantly longer among those who received gefitinib (HR, 0.48; 95% CI, 0.36–0.64; P < .001); however, in the subgroup of patients who were negative for a mutation, PFS was significantly longer in those who received the carboplatin-paclitaxel combination (HR with gefitinib, 2.85; 95% CI, 2.05–3.98; P < .001). There was a significant interaction between treatment and EGFR mutation with respect to PFS (P < .001).[53]

---START CHUNK 1276---
OS was similar for patients who received gefitinib and carboplatin-paclitaxel, with no significant difference between treatments overall (HR, 0.90; 95% CI, 0.79–1.02; P = .109) or in EGFR mutation–positive (HR, 1.00; 95% CI, 0.76–1.33; P = .990) or EGFR mutation–negative (HR, 1.18; 95% CI, 0.86–1.63; P = .309; treatment by EGFR mutation interaction P = .480) subgroups. A high proportion (64.3%) of EGFR mutation–positive patients randomly assigned to the carboplatin-paclitaxel regimen received subsequent EGFR TKIs. PFS was significantly longer with gefitinib for patients whose tumors had both high EGFR gene copy number and EGFR mutation (HR, 0.48; 95% CI, 0.34–0.67) but significantly shorter when high EGFR gene copy number was not accompanied by EGFR mutation (HR, 3.85; 95% CI, 2.09–7.09).

- A phase III trial from Japan prospectively confirmed that patients with NSCLC and EGFR mutations have improved PFS but not OS when treated with gefitinib. The trial included 230 chemotherapy-naïve patients with metastatic NSCLC and EGFR mutations who were randomly assigned to receive gefitinib or carboplatin-paclitaxel.[54]
In the planned interim analysis of data for the first 200 patients, PFS was significantly longer in the gefitinib group than in the standard-chemotherapy group (HRdeath or disease progression with gefitinib, 0.36; P < .001), resulting in early termination of the study.

The primary end point was PFS. In this study, the afatinib group had significantly longer PFS than the cisplatin-plus-pemetrexed group, with a median PFS of 11.1 months for afatinib and 6.9 months for chemotherapy (HR, 0.58; 95% CI, 0.43–0.78; P = .001).[59][Level of evidence B1]

---START CHUNK 1303---
Amivantamab has been previously approved for patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC harboring EGFR exon 20 insertion mutations whose disease has progressed on or after platinum-based chemotherapy.
Evidence (amivantamab plus chemotherapy):
- PAPILLON (NCT04538664) was a phase III randomized trial that compared amivantamab plus chemotherapy with chemotherapy alone as first-line treatment for patients with advanced NSCLC and EGFR exon 20 insertions. Patients in the chemotherapy-alone group who had disease progression were allowed to cross over to receive amivantamab monotherapy. A total of 308 patients were randomly assigned 1:1 to receive either amivantamab plus carboplatin and pemetrexed or carboplatin plus pemetrexed. The primary end point was PFS according to blinded independent central review. The median follow-up was 14.9 months.[62][Level of evidence B1]

---START CHUNK 1304---
At 18 months, the PFS rate was 31% for patients who received amivantamab plus chemotherapy, and 3% for patients who received chemotherapy alone.
The objective response rate was higher in the amivantamab-plus-chemotherapy group (73%) than the chemotherapy-alone group (47%).
In an interim OS analysis, there was no statistically significant difference.
The most common adverse events with amivantamab plus chemotherapy were hematologic toxicities, rash, and paronychia. Infusion reactions occurred in 42% of patients.
The study supports amivantamab plus chemotherapy as an effective first-line treatment option for patients with NSCLC and EGFR exon 20 insertions based on superior PFS when compared with chemotherapy alone.[62]

---START CHUNK 1307---
Evidence (alectinib):
- In an open-label, randomized, phase III study (the ALEX trial [NCT02075840]), 303 patients with previously untreated, advanced ALK-rearranged NSCLC received either alectinib (600 mg twice a day) or crizotinib (250 mg twice a day).[63] The primary end point was investigator-assessed PFS.
The rate of PFS was significantly higher with alectinib than crizotinib; the 12-month event-free survival rate was 68.4% for the alectinib group (95% CI, 61.0%–75.9%) compared with 48.7% for the crizotinib group (95% CI, 40.4%–56.9%) (HR, 0.47; 95% CI, 0.34–0.65; P < .001). The median PFS was not reached with alectinib. The results of independent review committee-assessed PFS were consistent.[63][Level of evidence B1]
CNS progression events were less frequent with alectinib (12%) than with crizotinib (45%) (HR, 0.16; 95% CI, 0.10–0.28; P <.001).
The response rate was similar for both groups, 82.9% for the alectinib group compared with 75.5% for the crizotinib group (P = .09).

- A second, open-label, randomized, phase III trial (J-ALEX) recruited 207 ALK-inhibitor–naïve Japanese patients with ALK-positive NSCLC who were chemotherapy-naïve or had received one previous chemotherapy regimen. Patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive alectinib (300 mg twice daily, which is the dose approved in Japan and is lower than the 600 mg twice daily dose approved elsewhere) versus crizotinib (250 mg twice daily).[64] The primary end point was PFS-assessed by an independent review committee.

---START CHUNK 1310---
At data cutoff for the second primary interim analysis, the independent data monitoring committee determined that the primary end point was met (HR, 0.34; 99.7% CI, 0.17–0.71; P <.0001) and recommended immediate release of the data. Median PFS had not been reached with alectinib but was reached at 10.2 months with crizotinib.
Grade 3 or 4 adverse events occurred less frequently with alectinib (26% occurrence rate) than with crizotinib (52% occurrence rate).

---START CHUNK 1312---
Evidence (lorlatinib):
- The phase III CROWN trial (NCT03052608) included patients with advanced ALK-rearranged NSCLC who had received no prior systemic therapy for metastatic disease. The trial randomly assigned 296 patients to receive either lorlatinib (100 mg daily) or crizotinib (250 mg twice daily). The primary end point was PFS as determined by blinded independent central review.[65][Level of evidence B1]
A planned interim analysis was conducted after approximately 75% of expected events of disease progression or death had occurred. The percentage of patients alive without progression at 12 months was 78% (95% CI, 70%–84%) in the lorlatinib group and 39% (95% CI, 30%–48%) in the crizotinib group. Objective responses occurred in 76% of patients who received lorlatinib and 58% of patients who received crizotinib.

---START CHUNK 1313---
Post hoc analysis showed improved PFS for the lorlatinib group, compared with the crizotinib group in patients with and without brain metastases at baseline (12-month PFS rates: 78% vs. 22% and 78% vs. 45%, respectively).[66]
There was a lower 12-month cumulative incidence of CNS progression with lorlatinib, compared with crizotinib in patients with (7% vs. 72%) and without (1% vs. 18%) brain metastases at baseline.
Lorlatinib was associated with more grade 3 to 4 adverse events than crizotinib (72% vs. 56%), the most common being altered lipid levels. Treatment discontinuation occurred in 7% of patients who received lorlatinib and 9% of patients who received crizotinib.[65]

---START CHUNK 1314---
Updated safety data in the post hoc analysis showed that 35% of patients had CNS adverse events with lorlatinib, most of grade 1 severity. These included memory impairment and mood effects, including anxiety, depression, and lability. The occurrence of CNS adverse events did not result in a clinically meaningful difference in patient-reported quality of life. At analysis, 56% of CNS adverse effects had resolved (33% without intervention; 17% with lorlatinib dose modification), and 38% were unresolved. Lorlatinib dose modification did not notably influence PFS.

Evidence (crizotinib):
- In an open-label, randomized, phase III study, 343 patients with stage IIIB/IV NSCLC harboring translocations in ALK received either 250 mg of crizotinib orally twice a day or the combination of pemetrexed and cisplatin or carboplatin for up to six cycles.[67] At the time of disease progression, patients on the chemotherapy arm were allowed to cross over to crizotinib; 60% of patients in the chemotherapy arm subsequently received crizotinib. The primary end point of this study was PFS.
The study met its primary end point and demonstrated that crizotinib is superior to chemotherapy in prolonging PFS (median, 10.9 months vs. 7.0 months; HR, 0.454; 95% CI, 0.346–0.596; P < .0001).[68][Level of evidence B1]

---START CHUNK 1323---
Evidence (brigatinib):
- A phase II, open-label trial (NCT02094573) enrolled 222 patients with ALK-translocated locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC who had disease progression after crizotinib treatment. Patients were randomly assigned to receive 90 mg every day (n = 112; 109 treated) or 180 mg every day with a 7-day lead-in at 90 mg every day (n = 110).[70]
The primary end point assessed by the investigators was objective response rate. The objective response rate was 45% (97.5% CI, 34%–56%) for patients who received the 90 mg dose and 54% (97.5% CI, 43%–65%) for patients who received the 180 mg dose.
Median PFS was 9.2 months (95% CI, 7.4–15.6) for patients who received the 90 mg dose and 12.9 months (95% CI, 11.1–not reached) for patients who received the 180 mg dose.
At data cutoff, the median DOR was 13.8 months (95% CI, 5.6–13.8) for patients who received the 90 mg dose and 11.1 months (95% CI, 9.2–13.8) for patients who received the 180 mg dose.[70][Level of evidence B3]

---START CHUNK 1324---
The CNS objective response rate in patients with measurable CNS lesions was 42% in patients who received 90 mg every day (n = 26) and 67% in patients who received 180 mg every day (n = 18).
Common adverse events, which were mainly grade 1 or 2 and occurred in 27% to 38% of patients at the higher dose, were nausea, diarrhea, headache, and cough. A subset of pulmonary adverse events with early onset (median onset, day 2) occurred in 14 of 219 treated patients (all grades, 6%; grade ≥3, 3%); none occurred after escalation to 180 mg. These events included dyspnea, hypoxia, cough, pneumonia, or pneumonitis. They were managed with dose interruption. Seven of the 14 patients were successfully retreated with brigatinib.

---START CHUNK 1329---
Evidence (dabrafenib and trametinib):
- In a phase II, multicenter, nonrandomized, open-label study (NCT01336634), 36 patients with previously untreated metastatic NSCLC who tested positive for BRAF V600E mutations were treated with dabrafenib (a BRAF inhibitor) 150 mg twice a day and trametinib (a MEK inhibitor) 2 mg every day.[71] BRAF V600E mutations were identified by the Oncomine Dx Target Test (ThermoFisher Scientific). The primary end point was investigator-assessed overall response.
The overall response rate was 64% (95% CI, 46%–79%). Six percent of patients had a complete response, and 58% of patients had a partial response.
The median investigator-assessed PFS was 10.9 months (95% CI, 7.0–16.6). The estimated median DOR was 10.4 months (95% CI, 8.3–17.9). At data cutoff, 47% of patients had died, and the median OS was 24.6 months (95% CI, 12.3–not estimable).

---START CHUNK 1330---
Sixty-nine percent of patients had at least one grade 3 or 4 adverse event, of which the most common were pyrexia, ALT increase, hypertension, or vomiting.

---START CHUNK 1334---
The FDA approved entrectinib for treatment of patients with metastatic NSCLC whose tumors are ROS1-positive, regardless of the number of previous systemic therapies.
Evidence (entrectinib):
- The safety and clinical activity of entrectinib in ROS1 fusion-positive metastatic NSCLC was determined by integrated analysis of three multicenter, single-arm, open-label clinical trials (ALKA-372-001/EudraCT, 2012-000148-88, STARTRK-1 [NCT02097810], and STARTRK-2 [NCT02568267]).[73] Entrectinib was administered orally at a dose of at least 600 mg once daily. Primary end points were the objective response rate and the DOR determined by blinded independent central review. Of note, time-to-event end points are difficult to interpret in the absence of a control arm. Evaluation of tumor samples for the ROS1 gene fusion was conducted prospectively in local laboratories using either a FISH or next-generation sequencing (NGS) laboratory-developed test.

---START CHUNK 1335---
Seventeen (32%) patients had received no previous systemic therapy, 23 (43%) had received one previous therapy, and 13 (25%) had received two or more lines of treatment. CNS disease was present in 23 (43%) patients at baseline. Thirty-one (59%) patients were never-smokers and 52 (98%) patients had adenocarcinoma histology.
The objective response rate in 53 efficacy-evaluable patients was 77% (95% CI, 64%−88%). Six percent of patients had a complete response and 72% had a partial response. Among patients with CNS disease at baseline, the objective response rate was 74% (95% CI, 52%−90%) and all patients had a partial response. Among patients without CNS disease at baseline, the overall response rate was 80% (95% CI, 61%−92%) (10% had a complete response and 70% had a partial response).[73][Level of evidence C3]

---START CHUNK 1336---
The median DOR was 24.6 months (95% CI, 11.4−34.8) in efficacy-evaluable patients; 12.6 months (95% CI, 6.5−not estimable) in patients with baseline CNS disease, and 24.6 months (95% CI, 11.4−34.8) in those without CNS disease at baseline.
Treatment-related adverse events were assessed in 134 patients in the safety-evaluable population. Grade 1 or 2 treatment-related adverse events were observed in 79 patients (59%). Grade 3 or 4 treatment-related adverse events were observed in 46 patients (34%). Fifteen patients (11%) had serious treatment-related adverse events. There were no treatment-related deaths.
The median PFS was 19 months (95% CI, 12.2−36.6) in efficacy-evaluable patients; 13.6 months (95% CI, 4.5−not estimable) in patients with baseline CNS disease, and 26.3 months (95% CI, 15.7−36.6) in patients with no baseline CNS disease.

---START CHUNK 1346---
Evidence (larotrectinib):
- Larotrectinib was studied in three protocols: a phase I study involving adults, a phase I/II study involving children, and a phase II study involving adolescents and adults.[78] Fusions were confirmed in the tumors using either FISH or NGS methods. The primary end point for the combined analysis was objective response rate by independent review and was conducted with input from regulators with the goal of excluding a lower bound of less than 30% for response rate. In total, 55 patients with a median age of 45 years (range, 4 months‒76 years) were enrolled across 17 different NTRK fusion-positive tumor types. All patients had either metastatic disease (82%) or locally advanced unresectable disease (18%). Enrolled patients had received a median of two previous systemic therapies.
The objective response rate was 75% (95% CI, 61%‒75%) and 73% of these responses lasted at least 6 months.[78][Level of evidence C3]

---START CHUNK 1350---
Evidence (entrectinib):
- The safety and clinical activity of entrectinib in NTRK inhibitor-naïve patients with metastatic or locally-advanced solid tumors (including NSCLC) harboring NTRK1, NTRK2, or NTRK3 gene fusions was determined by integrated analysis of three early-phase, multicenter, single-arm, open-label clinical trials (ALKA-372-001/EudraCT, 2012-000148-88, STARTRK-1 [NCT02097810], and STARTRK-2 [NCT02568267]).[79] Treatment consisted of entrectinib administered orally at a dose of at least 600 mg once per day. The primary end points were objective response rate and median DOR, which were assessed by blinded independent central review. Of note, time-to-event end points are difficult to interpret in the absence of a control arm. Identification of positive NTRK gene fusion status was conducted prospectively in local laboratories or a central laboratory using various nucleic acid–based tests.

Dysregulation of the MET proto-oncogene resulting from disruption of distinct splice sites leads to loss of MET exon 14 and enhanced MET signaling. These MET alterations drive tumor proliferation, survival, invasion, and metastasis, and occur in 3% to 4% of patients with NSCLC.[83]

---START CHUNK 1369---
Evidence (tepotinib):
- An open-label phase II study (VISION [NCT02864992]) enrolled patients with MET exon 14 skipping mutations. The trial included 152 patients who received tepotinib (500 mg orally once daily). MET status was determined centrally, either via liquid biopsy (from circulating free DNA obtained from plasma; n = 66) or via tissue biopsy (n = 60). Twenty-seven patients had positive results from both methods. The primary end point was objective response.[84][Level of evidence C3]
Among the 99 patients who had been followed for at least 9 months (i.e., the efficacy population), the objective response rate as assessed by independent review was 46% (95% CI, 36%–57%), with a median DOR of 11.1 months (95% CI, 7.2–not estimable). Response rates were similar in the liquid biopsy and tissue biopsy groups.
Responses were similar regardless of prior therapy.

Pembrolizumab demonstrated significant improvement in median PFS (10.3 months vs. 6.0 months; HR, 0.50; 95% CI, 0.37–0.68; P < .001). The overall response rate (44.8% vs. 27.8%), the median DOR (not reached, [range, 1.9–14.5 months] vs. 6.3 months [range, 2.1–12.6 months]), and the estimated rate of OS at 6 months (80.2% vs. 72.4%; HR, 0.60; 95% CI, 0.41–0.89; P = .005) were all higher with pembrolizumab than with chemotherapy.
Further follow-up of this study confirmed an OS advantage in favor of pembrolizumab; the median OS for patients who received pembrolizumab was 30 months (95% CI, 18.3 months–not reached) versus 14.2 months for patients who received chemotherapy, with a 75% crossover to immunotherapy afterwards, suggesting the crossover did not impact survival.[89]

- A phase III open-label study (EMPOWER-Lung 1 [NCT03088540]) enrolled 710 patients with advanced NSCLC and PD-L1 tumor expression of at least 50%. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive cemiplimab-rwlc 350mg every 3 weeks for up to 108 weeks or platinum-doublet chemotherapy. Patients could cross over from chemotherapy to cemiplimab-rwlc in the event of disease progression. There was also the option to cross over to continue cemiplimab-rwlc plus four cycles of chemotherapy in the event of progression with cemiplimab alone. Primary end points were OS and PFS per blinded independent central review. The median follow-up was 37 months for the ITT population.[92,93][Level of evidence A1]
At 35 months of follow-up, in patients with PD-L1 expression ≥50%, the median OS was 26.1 months with cemiplimab-rwlc and 13.3 months with chemotherapy (HR, 0.57; P < .0001).

The median PFS was 8.1 months for patients who received cemiplimab-rwlc and 5.3 months for patients who received chemotherapy (HR, 0.51; P < .0001).
The objective response rate was 46% for patients who received cemiplimab-rwlc and 21% for patients who received chemotherapy (OR, 3.264; P < .0001).
Benefits were greater in patients with PD-L1 expression ≥90% versus 50% to 89%.
Among 64 patients who received cemiplimab-rwlc plus chemotherapy after initial progression on cemiplimab-rwlc alone, the median PFS was 6.6 months, the objective response rate was 31%, and the OS was 15.1 months.
The most common adverse reactions (>10%) with cemiplimab-rwlc were musculoskeletal pain, rash, anemia, fatigue, decreased appetite, pneumonia, and cough. The safety profile of cemiplimab-rwlc was consistent over longer follow-up.

Evidence (durvalumab plus tremelimumab plus chemotherapy):
- POSEIDON (NCT03164616), a phase III open-label trial, studied tremelimumab plus durvalumab and chemotherapy, durvalumab plus chemotherapy, and chemotherapy alone as first-line therapy in patients with metastatic NSCLC. The primary end points were PFS and OS for durvalumab plus chemotherapy versus chemotherapy. Key alpha-controlled secondary end points were PFS and OS for tremelimumab plus durvalumab and chemotherapy versus chemotherapy. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1:1) to one of the following three arms:[94][Level of evidence B1]
Arm 1: Tremelimumab 75 mg plus durvalumab 1,500 mg with platinum-based chemotherapy for up to four 21-day cycles followed by durvalumab once every 4 weeks until progression and one additional tremelimumab dose at week 16.
Arm 2: Durvalumab plus chemotherapy for up to four 21-day cycles followed by durvalumab once every 4 weeks until progression.

---START CHUNK 1408---
Arm 2: Durvalumab plus chemotherapy for up to four 21-day cycles followed by durvalumab once every 4 weeks until progression.
Arm 3: Platinum-based chemotherapy for up to six 21-day cycles (with or without maintenance pemetrexed).
The following results were observed:
Treatment with durvalumab significantly improved PFS compared with chemotherapy alone. The median PFS was 5.5 months for patients who received durvalumab plus chemotherapy and 4.8 months for patients who received chemotherapy alone (HR, 0.74; 95% CI, 0.62–0.89; P = .0009).
A trend for improved OS did not reach statistical significance for patients in arms 2 and 3. The median OS was 13.3 months for patients who received durvalumab plus chemotherapy and 11.7 months for patients who received chemotherapy alone. (HR, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.72–1.02; P = .0758). The 24-month OS rate was 29.6% in the durvalumab-plus-chemotherapy arm and 22.1% in the chemotherapy-alone arm.

---START CHUNK 1409---
Both PFS and OS were significantly improved when tremelimumab therapy was added to durvalumab and chemotherapy compared with chemotherapy alone. The median PFS was 6.2 months for patients who received tremelimumab plus durvalumab and chemotherapy and 4.8 months for patients who received chemotherapy alone (HR, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.60–0.86; P = .0003). The median OS was 14.0 months in the tremelimumab arm and 11.7 months in the chemotherapy-alone arm (HR, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.65–0.92; P = .0030). The 24-month OS rate was 32.9% in the tremelimumab-plus durvalumab-and-chemotherapy arm and 22.1% in the chemotherapy-alone arm.

Evidence (atezolizumab alone):
- A phase III open-label study (IMpower110 [NCT02409342]) included 572 patients with previously untreated metastatic nonsquamous or squamous NSCLC. Patients had PD-L1 expression on at least 1% of tumor cells or on at least 1% of tumor-infiltrating immune cells. Patients were randomly assigned to receive either atezolizumab (1,200 mg intravenously) or platinum-based chemotherapy (4 or 6 cycles) once every 3 weeks. The primary end point was OS in the PD-L1–selected population that excluded sensitizing EGFR mutations or ALK translocations.[95][Level of evidence A1]
PD-L1 expression was assessed by the SP142 immunohistochemical assay. High expression was defined as more than 50% of tumor cells or more than 10% of tumor-infiltrating immune cells expressing PD-L1.
In the 205 patients with high PD-L1 expression, the median OS was 20.2 months for patients who received atezolizumab and 13.1 months for patients who received chemotherapy (HRdeath, 0.59; P = .01).

All patients received maintenance therapy as follows: (1) patients in the atezolizumab-plus-chemotherapy group received atezolizumab 1,200 mg intravenously every 3 weeks until investigator-assessed loss of clinical benefit or toxicity, and (2) patients in the chemotherapy-alone group received best supportive care or pemetrexed switch maintenance therapy until disease progression or toxicity. Coprimary end points were investigator-assessed PFS and OS in the ITT population with EGFR wild-type and ALK wild-type tumors.[96][Level of evidence A1]

---START CHUNK 1421---
In the ITT wild-type population, the median OS was 18.6 months (95% CI, 16.0–21.2) in the atezolizumab-plus-chemotherapy group and 13.9 months (95% CI, 12.0–18.7) in the chemotherapy group (stratified HR, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.64–0.98; P = .033).

Patients were treated until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity or up to 2 years for immunotherapy. Coprimary end points were OS with nivolumab-plus-ipilimumab compared with chemotherapy in patients with tumor PD-L1 expression of at least 1%, and PFS with nivolumab-plus-ipilimumab compared with chemotherapy in patients with high tumor mutational burden (TMB) (≥10 mutations per megabase).[2,99][Level of evidence A1]

---START CHUNK 1438---
Among patients with tumor PD-L1 ≥1% (n = 1,189), the median OS was 17.1 months (95% CI, 15.0–20.2) with nivolumab-plus-ipilimumab and 14.9 months (95% CI, 12.7–16.7) with chemotherapy (HR, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.66–0.91; P = .007). Five-year outcomes with nivolumab-plus-ipilimumab versus chemotherapy showed durable clinical benefit, with an OS rate of 24% with nivolumab-plus-ipilimumab and 14% for chemotherapy alone.[98]
In patients with TMB-high NSCLC, the median PFS was 7.2 months (95% CI, 5.5–13.2) with nivolumab-plus-ipilimumab, versus 5.5 months (95% CI, 4.4–5.8) with chemotherapy alone (HR, 0.58; 97.5% CI, 0.41–0.81; P < .001).

Among patients with tumor PD-L1 <1% (n = 550), the median OS was 17.4 months (95% CI, 13.2–22.0) with nivolumab-plus-ipilimumab, and 12.2 months (95% CI, 9.2–14.3) with chemotherapy alone (HR, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.52–0.81). Five-year outcomes with nivolumab-plus-ipilimumab versus chemotherapy alone showed durable clinical benefit, with an OS rate of 19% for nivolumab-plus-ipilimumab and 7% for chemotherapy alone.[98]
The frequency of grade 3 to 4 treatment-related adverse events was similar in both groups (32.8% with nivolumab-plus-ipilimumab vs. 36.0% with chemotherapy alone). Treatment-related adverse events leading to therapy discontinuation were more common with nivolumab-plus-ipilimumab than with chemotherapy alone (24.5% vs. 13.9%).

- Among patients with tumor PD-L1 ≥1% (n = 1,189), the median OS was 17.1 months (95% CI, 15.0–20.2) with nivolumab-plus-ipilimumab and 14.9 months (95% CI, 12.7–16.7) with chemotherapy (HR, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.66–0.91; P = .007). Five-year outcomes with nivolumab-plus-ipilimumab versus chemotherapy showed durable clinical benefit, with an OS rate of 24% with nivolumab-plus-ipilimumab and 14% for chemotherapy alone.[98]

- In patients with TMB-high NSCLC, the median PFS was 7.2 months (95% CI, 5.5–13.2) with nivolumab-plus-ipilimumab, versus 5.5 months (95% CI, 4.4–5.8) with chemotherapy alone (HR, 0.58; 97.5% CI, 0.41–0.81; P < .001).
- Among patients with tumor PD-L1 <1% (n = 550), the median OS was 17.4 months (95% CI, 13.2–22.0) with nivolumab-plus-ipilimumab, and 12.2 months (95% CI, 9.2–14.3) with chemotherapy alone (HR, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.52–0.81). Five-year outcomes with nivolumab-plus-ipilimumab versus chemotherapy alone showed durable clinical benefit, with an OS rate of 19% for nivolumab-plus-ipilimumab and 7% for chemotherapy alone.[98]
- The frequency of grade 3 to 4 treatment-related adverse events was similar in both groups (32.8% with nivolumab-plus-ipilimumab vs. 36.0% with chemotherapy alone). Treatment-related adverse events leading to therapy discontinuation were more common with nivolumab-plus-ipilimumab than with chemotherapy alone (24.5% vs. 13.9%).

The FDA approved nivolumab-plus-ipilimumab as ﬁrst-line therapy for patients with advanced NSCLC with PD-L1 expression of at least 1% and no EGFR or ALK genomic aberrations. While this regimen is not FDA-approved for patients with PD-L1 expression less than 1%, these patients were noted to have durable clinical benefit in CheckMate 227.

---START CHUNK 1444---
Everolimus is used for patients with unresectable, locally advanced or metastatic, progressive, well-differentiated, nonfunctional, neuroendocrine tumors.
Everolimus, an oral mTOR inhibitor, is clinically active against advanced pancreatic and nonpancreatic neuroendocrine tumors.[100] Based on the results of the RADIANT-4 clinical trial,[100] the FDA approved everolimus for the treatment of adult patients with unresectable, locally advanced or metastatic, progressive, well-differentiated (low or intermediate grade), nonfunctional neuroendocrine tumors of lung or gastrointestinal origin.
Evidence (everolimus):

---START CHUNK 1445---
Evidence (everolimus):
- A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase III trial (RADIANT-4 [NCT01524783]) evaluated everolimus in patients older than 18 years with advanced, progressive, well-differentiated, nonfunctional neuroendocrine tumors of lung or gastrointestinal origin.[100] Eligible patients were randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to received everolimus 10 mg daily orally or placebo, both with best supportive care. A total of 302 patients were enrolled (205 in the everolimus arm and 97 in the placebo arm), including 90 patients with neuroendocrine tumors of lung origin (63 in the everolimus arm and 27 in the placebo arm). The primary end point was PFS assessed by central radiology review in the ITT population.
Median PFS was 11.0 months in the everolimus arm and 3.9 months in the placebo group (HR, 0.48; 95% CI, 0.35−0.67; P < .00001).[100][Level of evidence B1]

---START CHUNK 1446---
Median PFS was 11.0 months in the everolimus arm and 3.9 months in the placebo group (HR, 0.48; 95% CI, 0.35−0.67; P < .00001).[100][Level of evidence B1]
In a post hoc analysis of the lung subgroup, median PFS by central review was 9.2 months in the everolimus arm and 3.6 months in the placebo arm (HR, 0.50; 95% CI, 0.28−0.88).[100]
The objective response rate was 2% in patients who received everolimus and 1% in patients who received placebo. Disease stabilization was observed in 81% of patients in the everolimus arm and 64% of patients in the placebo arm.
The median duration of treatment was longer in the patients who received everolimus compared with those who received placebo (40.4 weeks vs. 19.6 weeks).
A planned interim analysis of OS showed a 36% reduction in the estimated risk of death with everolimus relative to placebo (HR, 0.64; 95% CI, 0.40−1.05). These results were not statistically significant.

---START CHUNK 1447---
The most common treatment-related adverse events were stomatitis, diarrhea, fatigue, infections, rash, and peripheral edema. The most common drug-related grade 3 or 4 adverse events were stomatitis, diarrhea, infections, anemia, and fatigue. Grade 3 or 4 adverse events resulted in treatment discontinuation in 12% of patients in the everolimus group and 3% of patients in the placebo group.

Radiation therapy may be effective in palliating symptomatic patients with local involvement of NSCLC with any of the following:
- Tracheal, esophageal, or bronchial compression.
- Pain.
- Vocal cord paralysis.
- Hemoptysis.
- Superior vena cava syndrome.
In some cases, endobronchial laser therapy and/or brachytherapy have been used to alleviate proximal obstructing lesions.[20]

---START CHUNK 1451---
Although EBRT is frequently prescribed for symptom palliation, there is no consensus on which fractionation scheme should be used. Although different multifraction regimens appear to provide similar symptom relief,[101-106] single-fraction radiation may be insufficient for symptom relief compared with hypofractionated or standard regimens, as evidenced in the NCT00003685 trial.[21][Level of evidence A3] Evidence of a modest increase in survival in patients with a better performance status given high-dose radiation therapy is available.[23,107][Level of evidence A1] In closely observed asymptomatic patients, treatment may often be appropriately deferred until symptoms or signs of a progressive tumor develop.
Evidence (radiation therapy):
- A systematic review identified six randomized trials of high-dose rate endobronchial brachytherapy (HDREB) alone or with EBRT or laser therapy.[108]

- A systematic review identified six randomized trials of high-dose rate endobronchial brachytherapy (HDREB) alone or with EBRT or laser therapy.[108]
Better overall symptom palliation and fewer re-treatments were required in previously untreated patients using EBRT alone.[108][Level of evidence A3]
HDREB provided palliation of symptomatic patients with recurrent endobronchial obstruction previously treated by EBRT, when it was technically feasible.

---START CHUNK 1454---
A solitary pulmonary metastasis from an initially resected bronchogenic carcinoma is unusual. The lung is frequently the site of second primary malignancies in patients with primary lung cancers. Whether the new lesion is a new primary cancer or a metastasis may be difficult to determine. Studies have indicated that in most patients the new lesion is a second primary tumor, and after its resection, some patients may achieve long-term survival. Thus, if the first primary tumor has been controlled, the second primary tumor should be resected, if possible.[109,110]

---START CHUNK 1456---
Patients who present with a solitary cerebral metastasis after resection of a primary NSCLC lesion and who have no evidence of extracranial tumor can achieve prolonged disease-free survival with surgical excision of the brain metastasis and postoperative whole-brain radiation therapy.[111,112] Unresectable brain metastases in this setting may be treated with stereotactic radiosurgery.[113]
Approximately 50% of patients treated with resection and postoperative radiation therapy will develop recurrence in the brain; some of these patients will be suitable for additional treatment.[114] In those selected patients with good performance status and without progressive metastases outside of the brain, treatment options include reoperation or stereotactic radiation surgery.[113,114] For most patients, additional radiation therapy can be considered; however, the palliative benefit of this treatment is limited.[115][Level of evidence C2]

---START CHUNK 1501---
The use of chemotherapy has produced objective responses and small improvement in survival for patients with metastatic disease.[1][Level of evidence A1] In studies that have examined symptomatic response, improvement in subjective symptoms has been reported to occur more frequently than objective response.[2,3] Informed patients with good performance status and symptomatic recurrence can be offered treatment with a platinum-based chemotherapy regimen for palliation of symptoms. For patients who have relapsed after platinum-based chemotherapy, second-line therapy can be considered.

Evidence (docetaxel):
- Two prospective randomized studies have shown an improvement in survival with the use of docetaxel compared with vinorelbine, ifosfamide, or best supportive care;[4,5] however, criteria for the selection of appropriate patients for second-line treatment are not well defined.[6]
- A meta-analysis of five trials of 865 patients assessing the efficacy and safety of docetaxel administered weekly or every 3 weeks has been reported.[7] In that analysis, the following was shown:
Median survival was 27.4 weeks for patients treated every 3 weeks and 26.1 weeks for patients treated weekly (log-rank P = .24).
Significantly less severe neutropenia and febrile neutropenia were reported with weekly docetaxel (P < .001 for both); however, no significant differences were observed for anemia, thrombocytopenia, and nonhematologic toxic effects.

---START CHUNK 1506---
Evidence (docetaxel plus ramucirumab):

---START CHUNK 1507---
- In a double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase III study, 1,253 patients with an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 to 1 who had progressive disease after first-line chemotherapy were randomly assigned to receive docetaxel and placebo or docetaxel and ramucirumab.[8][Level of evidence A1] Ramucirumab is a human immunoglobulin G1 monoclonal antibody that targets the extracellular domain of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2. The primary end point of the study was overall survival (OS), with secondary end points of progression-free survival (PFS) and objective response rate. The study enrolled patients with either nonsquamous or squamous NSCLC; however, patients with poorly controlled hypertension, gastrointestinal perforation or fistulae, arterial thromboembolic event within 6 months (before random assignment), gross hemoptysis within 2 months, or grade 3 to 4 gastrointestinal bleeding within 3 months were excluded. In addition, the trial did

---START CHUNK 1509---
The addition of ramucirumab to docetaxel compared with placebo plus docetaxel led to an increase in median OS (10.5 months vs. 9.1 months; hazard ratio [HR], 0.86; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.75–0.98), objective response rate (23% vs. 14%), and PFS (4.5 months vs. 3 months). The improvement in OS from the addition of ramucirumab appeared consistent across subgroups including squamous and nonsquamous histologies.
Grade 3 to 4 treatment-related adverse events occurred in 79% of patients who received docetaxel and ramucirumab as compared with 71% of patients who received docetaxel and placebo. Febrile neutropenia, fatigue, and hypertension were among the toxicities that were more common with the addition of ramucirumab to docetaxel. There was no significant difference in the incidence of grades 3 to 4 hemorrhage between the groups.

---START CHUNK 1515---
Advanced NSCLC that contains characteristic mutations in EGFR, most commonly exon 19 deletions or exon 21 L858R mutations, is highly sensitive to EGFR TKIs. The standard approach to decide whether to use an EGFR TKI for the treatment of a patient with advanced NSCLC is to analyze the tumor for the presence or absence of a driver mutation in EGFR. EGFR exon 20 insertions are uncommon mutations that are not sensitive to the EGFR TKIs used for the treatment of NSCLC with EGFR-sensitizing mutations.

Evidence (erlotinib):
Two randomized placebo-controlled trials indicated that erlotinib prolongs survival and time to deterioration in symptoms in patients with NSCLC after first-line or second-line chemotherapy compared with placebo [11,12] but does not improve survival compared with standard second-line chemotherapy with docetaxel or pemetrexed.[13]
- A trial of erlotinib versus best supportive care included 731 patients; 49% had received two previous chemotherapy regimens, and 93% had received platinum-based chemotherapy.
OS was 6.7 months among those who had received two previous chemotherapy regimens and 4.7 months among those who had received platinum-based chemotherapy. The HR was 0.70 (P < .001) in favor of erlotinib.[11][Level of evidence A1]

Gefitinib did not improve OS.
Median survival did not differ significantly between the groups in the overall population (5.6 months for gefitinib and 5.1 months for placebo; HR, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.77–1.02; P = .087) or among the 812 patients with adenocarcinoma (6.3 months vs. 5.4 months; HR, 0.84; CI, 0.68–1.03; P = .089).

---START CHUNK 1522---
- In a large randomized trial, gefitinib was compared with docetaxel in patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC who had been pretreated with platinum-based chemotherapy.[15] The primary objective was to compare OS between the groups with coprimary analyses to assess noninferiority in the overall population and superiority in patients with high EGFR gene copy number in the intention-to-treat population. The 1,466 patients were randomly assigned to receive gefitinib (250 mg per day by mouth; n = 733) or docetaxel (75 mg/m2 intravenously [IV] every 3 weeks; n = 733).
Noninferiority of gefitinib compared with docetaxel was confirmed for OS (HR, 1.020; 95% CI, 0.905–1.150). However, superiority of gefitinib in patients with high EGFR gene copy number (85 patients vs. 89 patients) was not proven (HR, 1.09; 95% CI, 0.78–1.51; P = .62).

---START CHUNK 1523---
In the gefitinib group, the most common adverse events were rash or acne (49% vs. 10%) and diarrhea (35% vs. 25%). In the docetaxel group, neutropenia (5% vs. 74%), asthenia (25% vs. 47%), and alopecia (3% vs. 36%) were most common.
This trial established noninferior survival of patients treated with gefitinib compared with docetaxel, suggesting that gefitinib is a valid treatment for pretreated patients with advanced NSCLC.

In a randomized, controlled, phase III trial (LUX-Lung 8 [NCT01523587]), patients with stage IIIB/IV squamous cell NSCLC with disease progression after frontline platinum-based chemotherapy were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive afatinib (398 patients, 40 mg by mouth every day) or erlotinib (397 patients, 150 mg by mouth every day).[24][Level of evidence B1] The primary end point was PFS. Secondary end points included OS and response rate.
After a median follow-up of 6.7 months, the PFS was 2.4 months versus 1.9 months (HR, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.68–1.00).

---START CHUNK 1527---
After a median follow-up of 6.7 months, the PFS was 2.4 months versus 1.9 months (HR, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.68–1.00).
After a median follow-up of 18.4 months, the median OS was significantly longer in the afatinib arm (7.9 months vs. 6.8 months; HR, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.69–0.95; P = .007). Survival at 6 months (63.6% vs. 54.6%; P = .009), 12 months (36.4% vs. 28.2%; P = .015), and 18 months (22% vs. 14.4%; P = .013) were all significantly better in patients who received afatinib.
There was no significant difference in response rate between the two arms (6% vs. 3%; P = .551).
The frequency of adverse events was similar between the two groups with 57% of the patients experiencing a rate of grade 3 or higher adverse events.

---START CHUNK 1535---
Evidence (amivantamab):
- A phase I, open-label, dose-escalation, and dose-expansion study (CHRYSALIS [NCT02609776]) investigated amivantamab, an EGFR-MET bispecific antibody, in several different patient groups. A total of 114 patients with EGFR exon 20 insertion mutations who had received previous platinum-based chemotherapy received the recommended phase II dose of amivantamab (1,050 mg [1,400 mg if >80 kg] IV) once weekly for the first 4 weeks and then once every 2 weeks starting at week 5. The primary end point for the dose-expansion group was overall response rate.[26][Level of evidence C3]
At the time of clinical data cutoff, 81 patients were evaluable with at least three disease assessments. The overall response rate was 40% (95% CI, 29%–51%), including three complete responses. The median duration of response (DOR) was 11.1 months (95% CI, 6.9–not reached). The clinical benefit rate (including patients with stable disease) was 74% (95% CI, 63%–83%).

The median PFS was 8.3 months (95% CI, 6.5–10.9); OS data are not mature.
The most common adverse events were rash (86%), infusion-related reactions (66%), and paronychia (45%). Patients experienced adverse events related to both EGFR inhibition (rash, paronychia, stomatitis, pruritus, diarrhea) and MET inhibition (hypoalbuminemia, peripheral edema). Grade 3 or greater adverse events occurred in 35% of patients, with rash (4%) and infusion reactions (3%) as the most common.
The infusion reactions occurred primarily with the first exposure to amivantamab. The administration of the first dose was split over 2 days to minimize this toxicity.

Survival in 30 ALK-positive patients who were given crizotinib in the second-line or third-line setting was significantly longer than in 23 ALK-positive controls identified from a different cohort given any second-line therapy (median OS not reached [95% CI, 14 months–not reached] vs. 6 months [95% CI, 4–17], 1-year OS rate, 70% [95% CI, 50%–83%] vs. 44% [95% CI, 23%–64%], and 2-year OS rate, 55% [33%–72%] vs. 12% [2%–30%]; HR, 0.36; 95% CI, 0.17–0.75; P = .004).[29][Level of evidence C2]
Common toxicities were grade 1 or 2 (mild) gastrointestinal side effects.
Patients with ALK rearrangements tended to be younger than those without the rearrangements; most of the patients had little or no exposure to tobacco; and the patients had adenocarcinomas.

The primary end point was investigator-assessed overall response.
The overall response rate was 63.2% (95% CI, 49.3%–75.6%), as determined independently by investigator and independent review committee assessments. There were 2 out of 36 complete responses by investigator assessment; all responses were deemed partial by the independent review committee.
The median investigator-assessed PFS was 9.7 months (95% CI, 6.9–19.6 months). The estimated median DOR was 9.0 months (95% CI, 6.9–18.3). The OS data are immature.

---START CHUNK 1576---
The FDA approved entrectinib for treatment of patients with metastatic NSCLC whose tumors are ROS1-positive, regardless of the number of previous systemic therapies.
Evidence (entrectinib):
- The safety and clinical activity of entrectinib in ROS1 fusion-positive metastatic NSCLC was determined by integrated analysis of three multicenter, single-arm, open-label clinical trials (ALKA-372-001/EudraCT, 2012-000148-88, STARTRK-1 [NCT02097810], and STARTRK-2 [NCT02568267]).[38] Entrectinib was administered orally at a dose of at least 600 mg once daily. Primary end points were the overall response rate and the DOR determined by blinded independent central review. Of note, time-to-event end points are difficult to interpret in the absence of a control arm. Evaluation of tumor samples for the ROS1 gene fusion was conducted prospectively in local laboratories using either a FISH or next-generation sequencing (NGS) laboratory-developed test.

---START CHUNK 1588---
Evidence (larotrectinib):
- Larotrectinib was studied in three protocols: a phase I study involving adults, a phase I/II study involving children, and a phase II study involving adolescents and adults.[43] Fusions were confirmed in the tumors using either FISH or NGS methods. The primary end point for the combined analysis was objective response rate by independent review and was conducted with input from regulators with the goal of excluding a lower bound of less than 30% for response rate. In total, 55 patients with a median age of 45 years (range, 4 months‒76 years) were enrolled across 17 different NTRK fusion-positive tumor types. All patients had either metastatic disease (82%) or locally advanced unresectable disease (18%). Enrolled patients had received a median of two previous systemic therapies.

Dysregulation of the MET proto-oncogene resulting from disruption of distinct splice sites leads to loss of MET exon 14 and enhanced MET signaling. These MET alterations drive tumor proliferation, survival, invasion, and metastasis, and occur in 3% to 4% of patients with NSCLC.[48]

Evidence (tepotinib):
- An open-label phase II study (VISION [NCT02864992]) enrolled patients with MET exon 14 skipping mutations. The trial included 152 patients who received tepotinib (500 mg orally once daily). MET status was determined centrally either via liquid biopsy (from circulating free DNA obtained from plasma; n = 66) or via tissue biopsy (n = 60). Twenty-seven patients had positive results from both methods. The primary end point was objective response.[49][Level of evidence C3]

Evidence (nivolumab):
In two phase III clinical trials, one conducted in patients with advanced platinum-pretreated squamous NSCLC and the other trial conducted in patients with nonsquamous NSCLC, nivolumab demonstrated a significant improvement in OS compared with the previous standard treatment of docetaxel chemotherapy.[56,57][Level of evidence A1] In addition, the rates of grade 3 and 4 treatment-related toxicity in both trials were significantly lower with nivolumab than with docetaxel. Of note, all patients enrolled in phase III studies of nivolumab had an ECOG performance status of 0 or 1; patients with autoimmune disease, symptomatic interstitial lung disease, or those receiving systemic immunosuppression were excluded from enrollment.

---START CHUNK 1637---
- A randomized, open-label, phase III trial randomly assigned 272 patients with advanced squamous cell NSCLC who had received one regimen of platinum-containing chemotherapy to receive either nivolumab (3 mg/kg every 2 weeks) or docetaxel (75 mg/m2 every 3 weeks), administered until disease progression.[56] The primary end point of this study was OS.
Nivolumab demonstrated a significant improvement in median OS compared with docetaxel (9.2 months vs. 6 months; P < .001). In addition, the response rate (20% vs. 9%; P = .008) and median PFS (3.5 months vs. 2.8 months; P < .001) favored nivolumab.
Rates of treatment-related toxicity were significantly lower with nivolumab than with docetaxel (all grades, 58% for nivolumab vs. 86% for docetaxel; grades 3–4, 7% for nivolumab vs. 55% for docetaxel).

---START CHUNK 1639---
- A randomized, open-label, phase III trial included 582 patients with advanced nonsquamous NSCLC who had received one regimen of platinum-containing chemotherapy. Patients were randomly assigned to receive either nivolumab (3 mg/kg every 2 weeks) or docetaxel (75 mg/m2 every 3 weeks), administered until disease progression.[57] Previous maintenance chemotherapy after first-line platinum-doublet was allowed; patients with EGFR mutations or ALK translocations were allowed to have received an additional regimen of therapy with a TKI. The primary end point of this study was OS.

Patients who received nivolumab had a significant improvement in median OS compared with patients who received docetaxel (12.2 months vs. 9.4 months; HR, 0.73; 96% CI, 0.59–0.89; P = .002). In this study, the response rate (19% vs. 12%; P = .02) but not median PFS (2.3 months for nivolumab vs. 4.2 months for docetaxel) favored nivolumab.

---START CHUNK 1642---
Both of these trials demonstrated long-term clinical benefit at the 2-year outcomes. The OS rates for nivolumab at 2 years compared with docetaxel in squamous NSCLC were 23% (95% CI, 16%–30%) versus 8% (95% CI, 4%–13%), and OS rates in nonsquamous NSCLC were 29% (95% CI, 24%–34%) versus 16% (95% CI, 12%–20%).[59] Ongoing responses at 2 years were observed in 10 (37%) confirmed responders with squamous NSCLC and 19 (34%) of 56 responders with nonsquamous NSCLC. No patient treated with docetaxel in either study had an ongoing response.

---START CHUNK 1643---
Nivolumab is now considered a standard second-line therapy for patients with metastatic NSCLC with progression on or after first-line platinum-based chemotherapy and is associated with improved survival and lower rates of toxicity than docetaxel. However, clinical trials of nivolumab to date have not enrolled patients with a history of autoimmune disease, interstitial lung disease, or an ECOG performance status higher than 1. Patients with active autoimmune conditions cannot be treated with nivolumab. Closely monitoring all patients for autoimmune toxicities from treatment is required. Specific algorithms for the management of autoimmune toxicity are included in the FDA label for nivolumab.

---START CHUNK 1645---
Evidence (pembrolizumab):
- In a phase I study with multiple expansion cohorts, pembrolizumab demonstrated significant activity with respect to response rate and DOR.[58][Level of evidence C3]

---START CHUNK 1646---
In the study, 495 patients received either pembrolizumab 2 mg/kg every 3 weeks, 10 mg/kg every 3 weeks, or 10 mg/kg every 2 weeks. No significant differences were seen among the different treatment schedules. Key exclusion criteria were autoimmune disease, history of pneumonitis, requirement for systemic immunosuppressive therapy, and a performance status higher than 1. The objective response rate was 19.4% (95% CI, 16.0%–23.2%), which included a response rate of 18.0% (95% CI, 14.4%–22.2%) in 394 previously treated patients and 24.8% (95% CI, 16.7%–34.3%) in 101 previously untreated patients. Median PFS was 3.7 months (95% CI, 2.9–4.1) for all patients, 3.0 months (95% CI, 2.2–4.0) for previously treated patients, and 6.0 months (95% CI, 4.1–8.6) for previously untreated patients. The median DOR was 12.5 months (range, 1.0–23.3 months) in all patients.

---START CHUNK 1647---
The study evaluated the efficacy of pembrolizumab in patients with high levels of PD-L1, as assessed by the anti-PD-L1 antibody clone 22C3. Using the cutoff of membranous staining in at least 50% of tumor cells in a validation group of 73 patients, the response rate was 45.2% (95% CI, 33.5%–57.3%), and the median PFS in this group was 6.3 months (95% CI, 2.9–12.5). Median OS was not reached at the time of publication.
The estimated prevalence of PD-L1 tumor staining from 1,143 screened patients, of whom 824 had evaluable samples, is as follows: 23.2% had 50% or more tumor cells with staining; 37.6% had between 1% and 49% tumor cells with staining; and 39.2% had less than 1% of tumor cells with staining.

---START CHUNK 1648---
The most common adverse events were fatigue, pruritus, and decreased appetite. Grade 3 or higher adverse events were reported in 9.5% of patients. Inflammatory and immune-mediated adverse events that occurred in more than 2% of patients were infusion-related reactions (3.0%), hypothyroidism (6.9%), and pneumonitis (3.6%).

---START CHUNK 1649---

Inflammatory and immune-mediated adverse events that occurred in more than 2% of patients were infusion-related reactions (3.0%), hypothyroidism (6.9%), and pneumonitis (3.6%).
- In a phase II/III randomized clinical trial, patients with previously treated NSCLC with PD-L1 expression on at least 1% of tumor cells were randomly assigned (1:1:1) to receive pembrolizumab (2 mg/kg), pembrolizumab (10 mg/kg), or docetaxel (75 mg/m2) every 3 weeks.[60][Level of evidence A1] The primary end points were OS and PFS in the total population and in patients with PD-L1 expression on at least 50% of tumor cells. This study enrolled 1,034 patients; 345 of them were allocated to pembrolizumab (2 mg/kg); 346 were allocated to pembrolizumab (10 mg/kg); and 343 were allocated to docetaxel.

---START CHUNK 1652---
In the total population, median OS was 10.4 months with pembrolizumab (2 mg/kg), 12.7 months with pembrolizumab (10 mg/kg), and 8.5 months with docetaxel. OS was significantly longer for pembrolizumab (2 mg/kg) versus docetaxel (HR 0.71; 95% CI, 0.58–0.88; P = .0008) and for pembrolizumab (10 mg/kg) versus docetaxel (HR, 0.61; CI, 0.49–0.75; P < .0001).
In the total population, PFS was not prolonged in the pembrolizumab groups compared with the docetaxel group.
Among patients with at least 50% of tumor cells expressing PD-L1, OS was significantly longer with pembrolizumab (2 mg/kg) than with docetaxel (median, 14.9 months vs. 8.2 months; HR, 0.54; 95% CI, 0.38–0.77; P = .0002) and with pembrolizumab (10 mg/kg) than with docetaxel (median, 17.3 months vs. 8.2 months; HR, 0.50; CI, 0.36–0.70; P < .0001).

---START CHUNK 1653---
In the group of patients with at least 50% of tumor cells expressing PD-L1, PFS was significantly longer with pembrolizumab (2 mg/kg) than with docetaxel (median, 5.0 months vs. 4.1 months; HR, 0.59; 95% CI, 0.44–0.78; P = .0001) and with pembrolizumab (10 mg/kg) than with docetaxel (median, 5.2 months vs. 4.1 months; HR, 0.59; CI, 0.45–0.78; P < .0001).
Grade 3 to 5 treatment-related adverse events were less common with pembrolizumab than with docetaxel (43 [13%] of 339 patients given pembrolizumab (2 mg/kg), 55 [16%] of 343 patients given pembrolizumab (10 mg/kg), and 109 [35%] of 309 patients given docetaxel).
- In the total population, median OS was 10.4 months with pembrolizumab (2 mg/kg), 12.7 months with pembrolizumab (10 mg/kg), and 8.5 months with docetaxel.

The FDA granted accelerated approval to pembrolizumab as a second-line therapy for patients with NSCLC whose tumors express PD-L1 (>50% staining as determined by an FDA-approved test) with progression on or after first-line chemotherapy. Patients with EGFR or ALK genomic tumor aberrations should have disease progression on FDA-approved therapies before receiving pembrolizumab (see the FDA label for pembrolizumab).

---START CHUNK 1657---
Evidence (atezolizumab):
- Two international, randomized, open-label clinical trials (OAK [NCT02008227] and POPLAR [NCT01903993]) demonstrated efficacy and safety in a total of 1,137 patients with NSCLC who previously received platinum chemotherapy.[61,62][Level of evidence A1] Compared with docetaxel, treatment with atezolizumab in the intended patient population resulted in improved OS rates of 4.2 months in the OAK study and 2.9 months in the POPLAR study.
In the OAK trial, the median OS was 13.8 months in the atezolizumab arm (95% CI, 11.8–15.7) compared with 9.6 months in the docetaxel arm (95% CI, 8.6–11.2) (HR, 0.74; 95% CI, 0.63–0.87; P = .0004).
The median OS in the POPLAR trial was 12.6 months in the atezolizumab arm (95% CI, 9.7–16.0) and 9.7 months in the docetaxel arm (95% CI, 8.6–12.0) (HR, 0.69; 95% CI, 0.52–0.92).

---START CHUNK 1658---
The median OS in the POPLAR trial was 12.6 months in the atezolizumab arm (95% CI, 9.7–16.0) and 9.7 months in the docetaxel arm (95% CI, 8.6–12.0) (HR, 0.69; 95% CI, 0.52–0.92).
Although the magnitude of improvement correlated with PD-L1 immunohistochemistry expression on tumor cells and tumor-infiltrating immune cells, survival benefit with atezolizumab was seen in patients with tumors with and without PD-L1 expression.
In the POPLAR trial, the most common (≥20%) adverse reactions were in patients treated with atezolizumab and included fatigue, decreased appetite, dyspnea, cough, nausea, musculoskeletal pain, and constipation.
The most common (≥2%) grade 3 to 4 adverse events in patients treated with atezolizumab were dyspnea, pneumonia, hypoxia, hyponatremia, fatigue, anemia, musculoskeletal pain, ALT and AST increase, dysphagia, and arthralgia.

---START CHUNK 1659---
Clinically significant immune-related adverse events for patients who received atezolizumab included pneumonitis, hepatitis, colitis, and thyroid disease.

---START CHUNK 1662---
Everolimus is used for patients with unresectable, locally advanced or metastatic, progressive, well-differentiated, nonfunctional, neuroendocrine tumors.
Everolimus, an oral mTOR inhibitor, is clinically active against advanced pancreatic and nonpancreatic neuroendocrine tumors.[63] Based on the results of the RADIANT-4 clinical trial,[63] the FDA approved everolimus for the treatment of adult patients with unresectable, locally advanced or metastatic, progressive, well-differentiated (low or intermediate grade), nonfunctional neuroendocrine tumors of lung or gastrointestinal origin.
Evidence (everolimus):

---START CHUNK 1663---
Evidence (everolimus):
- A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase III trial (RADIANT-4 [NCT01524783]) evaluated everolimus in patients older than 18 years with advanced, progressive, well-differentiated, nonfunctional neuroendocrine tumors of lung or gastrointestinal origin.[63] Eligible patients were randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to receive everolimus 10 mg daily orally or placebo, both with best supportive care. A total of 302 patients were enrolled (205 in the everolimus arm and 97 in the placebo arm), including 90 patients with neuroendocrine tumors of lung origin (63 in the everolimus arm and 27 in the placebo arm). The primary end point was PFS assessed by central radiology review in the intention-to-treat population.
Median PFS was 11.0 months in the everolimus arm and 3.9 months in the placebo group (HR, 0.48; 95% CI, 0.35−0.67; P < .00001).[63][Level of evidence B1]

---START CHUNK 1664---
Median PFS was 11.0 months in the everolimus arm and 3.9 months in the placebo group (HR, 0.48; 95% CI, 0.35−0.67; P < .00001).[63][Level of evidence B1]
In a post hoc analysis of the lung subgroup, median PFS by central review was 9.2 months in the everolimus arm and 3.6 months in the placebo arm (HR, 0.50; 95% CI, 0.28−0.88).[63]
The objective response rate was 2% in patients who received everolimus and 1% in patients who received placebo. Disease stabilization was observed in 81% of patients in the everolimus arm and 64% of patients in the placebo arm.
The median duration of treatment was longer in the patients who received everolimus compared with those who received placebo (40.4 weeks vs. 19.6 weeks).
A planned interim analysis of OS showed a 36% reduction in the estimated risk of death with everolimus relative to placebo (HR, 0.64; 95% CI, 0.40−1.05). These results were not statistically significant.

---START CHUNK 1665---
The most common treatment-related adverse events were stomatitis, diarrhea, fatigue, infections, rash, and peripheral edema. The most common drug-related grade 3 or 4 adverse events were stomatitis, diarrhea, infections, anemia, and fatigue. Grade 3 or 4 adverse events resulted in treatment discontinuation in 12% of patients in the everolimus group and 3% of patients in the placebo group.

Section: Key Statistics for Lung Cancer

Most lung cancer statistics include both small cell lung cancer (SCLC) and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). In general, about 13% of all lung cancers are SCLC, and about 87% are NSCLC.

Section: Key Statistics for Lung Cancer > How common is lung cancer?

---START CHUNK 1703---
Lung cancer (both small cell and non-small cell) is the second most common cancer in both men and women in the United States (not counting skin cancer). In men, prostate cancer is more common, while breast cancer is more common in women.
The American Cancer Society’s estimates for lung cancer in the US for 2025 are:
- About 226,650 new cases of lung cancer (110,680 in men and 115,970 in women)
- About 124,730 deaths from lung cancer (64,190 in men and 60,540 in women)
Lung cancer mainly occurs in older people. Most people diagnosed with lung cancer are 65 or older; a very small number of people diagnosed are younger than 45. The average age of people when diagnosed is about 70.
Lung cancer is by far the leading cause of cancer death in the US, accounting for about 1 in 5 of all cancer deaths. Each year, more people die of lung cancer than of colon, breast, and prostate cancers combined.

---START CHUNK 1704---
On a positive note, the number of new lung cancer cases continues to decrease, partly because more people are quitting smoking (or not starting). The number of deaths from lung cancer continues to drop as well, due to fewer people smoking and advances in early detection and treatment.

Section: Key Statistics for Lung Cancer > Lifetime chance of getting lung cancer

---START CHUNK 1706---
Overall, the chance that a man will develop lung cancer in his lifetime is about 1 in 17; for a woman, the risk is about 1 in 18. These numbers include both people who smoke and those who don’t smoke. For people who smoke, the risk is much higher, while for those who don't, the risk is lower.
- Black men are about 12% more likely to develop lung cancer than White men. The rate is about 16% lower in Black women than in White women.
- Black and White women have lower rates than men, but the gap is closing. The lung cancer rate has been dropping among men over the past few decades, but only for about the past decade in women.
- Despite their overall risk of lung cancer being higher, Black men are less likely to develop SCLC than White men.
Statistics on survival in people with lung cancer vary depending on the type of lung cancer, the stage (extent) of the cancer when it is diagnosed, and other factors. For survival statistics, see Lung Cancer Survival Rates.

Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is usually staged as either limited or extensive. For treatment of limited-stage SCLC, a combination of chemotherapy and radiation is usually given. For treatment of extensive-stage SCLC, a combination of chemotherapy and immunotherapy is usually given.

Section: Treatment Choices for Small Cell Lung Cancer, by Stage > Treating limited-stage SCLC

---START CHUNK 1721---
If you only have one small tumor in your lung and there is no evidence of cancer in lymph nodes or elsewhere, your doctors might recommend surgery to remove the tumor and the nearby lymph nodes.
Very few patients with SCLC are treated this way. This is only an option if you are in fairly good health and can withstand having part of a lung removed.
Before the operation, the lymph nodes in your chest will be checked for cancer with mediastinoscopy or other tests, because surgery is unlikely to be a good option if the cancer has spread there.

---START CHUNK 1722---
Before the operation, the lymph nodes in your chest will be checked for cancer with mediastinoscopy or other tests, because surgery is unlikely to be a good option if the cancer has spread there.
Surgery is generally followed by chemotherapy. If cancer is found in the lymph nodes that were removed, radiation therapy to the chest is also usually recommended. The radiation is often given at the same time as the chemo. Although this increases the side effects of treatment, it appears to be more effective than giving one treatment after the other. If you already have severe lung disease (in addition to your cancer) or other serious health problems, you might not be given radiation therapy.

---START CHUNK 1723---
For most people with limited-stage SCLC, surgery is not an option because the tumor is too large, it’s in a place that can’t be removed easily, or it has spread to nearby lymph nodes or other lobes in the same lung. If you are in good health, the standard treatment is chemo plus radiation to the chest given at the same time (called concurrent chemoradiation). The chemo drugs used are usually etoposide plus either cisplatin or carboplatin.
Concurrent chemoradiation can help people with limited-stage SCLC live longer and give them a better chance at a cure than giving one treatment (or one treatment at a time). The downside is that this combination has more side effects than either chemo or radiation alone.
People who aren’t healthy enough for chemoradiation are usually treated with chemo by itself. This may be followed by radiation to the chest.

---START CHUNK 1724---
People who aren’t healthy enough for chemoradiation are usually treated with chemo by itself. This may be followed by radiation to the chest.
After giving concurrent chemoradiation to people with limited-stage SCLC and if the lung cancer has not worsened at that point, they may benefit from treatment with durvalumab (Imfinzi). Durvalumab is a type of immunotherapy drug.
If no measures are taken to prevent it, about half of people with SCLC will have cancer spread to their brain. If your cancer has responded well to initial treatment, you may be given radiation therapy to the head (prophylactic cranial irradiation, or PCI) to try to prevent this. The radiation is usually given in lower doses than what is used if the cancer had already spread to brain, but some patients may still have side effects.

---START CHUNK 1725---
In most people with limited-stage SCLC, tumors treated with chemo (with or without radiation) will shrink significantly. In many, the tumor will shrink to the point where it can no longer be seen on imaging tests. Unfortunately, for most people, the cancer will return at some point.
Because these cancers are hard to cure, clinical trials of newer treatments may be a good option for some people. If you think you might want to take part in a clinical trial, talk to your doctor.

Section: Treatment Choices for Small Cell Lung Cancer, by Stage > Treating extensive-stage SCLC

---START CHUNK 1727---
Extensive-stage SCLC has spread too far for surgery or radiation therapy to be useful as the initial treatment. If you have extensive SCLC and are in fairly good health, chemotherapy (chemo), possibly along with an immunotherapy drug, is typically the first treatment. This can often shrink the cancer, treat your symptoms, and help you live longer.

---START CHUNK 1728---
The most common combination of chemo drugs is etoposide, plus either cisplatin or carboplatin. The immunotherapy drugs atezolizumab (Tecentriq) or durvalumab (Imfinzi) can be used along with etoposide and a platinum drug (cisplatin or carboplatin) for initial treatment and can then be continued alone as maintenance therapy. The cancer will shrink significantly with treatment in most people, and in some, the cancer might no longer be seen on imaging tests. This combination of PD-L1 immunotherapy with chemotherapy also seems to help some people with SCLC live longer. Unfortunately, the cancer often returns at some point in almost all people with extensive-stage SCLC.
If cancer growth in the lungs is causing symptoms, such as shortness of breath or bleeding, radiation therapy or other types of treatment, such as laser surgery, can sometimes be helpful. Radiation therapy can also be used to relieve symptoms if the cancer has spread to the bones, brain, or spinal cord.

---START CHUNK 1729---
If your overall health is poor, you might not be able to withstand the side effects of standard doses of chemo. If this is the case, your doctor may treat you with lower doses of chemo or palliative/supportive care alone. This would include treatment of any pain, breathing problems, or other symptoms you might have.
Because these cancers are hard to treat, clinical trials of newer chemo drugs and combinations, as well as other new treatments, could be a good option for some people. If you think you might be interested in taking part in a clinical trial, talk to your doctor.

---START CHUNK 1731---
If the cancer continues to grow during treatment or comes back, any further treatment will depend on the location and extent of the cancer, what treatments you’ve had, and on your health and desire for further treatment. It’s always important to understand the goal of any further treatment before it starts. You should understand if it’s to try to cure the cancer, to slow its growth, or to help relieve symptoms. It is also important to understand the benefits and risks.
If a cancer continues to grow during the initial chemotherapy treatment or if a cancer starts to grow after chemo has been stopped for less than 6 months, another type of chemo, such as topotecan may be tried, although it may be less likely to help. In these cases, if you are healthy enough, clinical trials are usually recommended.
For cancers that come back after initial treatment is finished, the choice of chemo drugs depends on how long the cancer was in remission. (See Chemotherapy for Small Cell Lung Cancer.)

---START CHUNK 1732---
For cancers that come back after initial treatment is finished, the choice of chemo drugs depends on how long the cancer was in remission. (See Chemotherapy for Small Cell Lung Cancer.)
Another option for people who have already received chemo might be the immunotherapy drug tarlatamab (Imdelltra).

The lungs are a pair of cone-shaped breathing organs in the chest. The lungs bring oxygen into the body as you breathe in. They release carbon dioxide, a waste product of the body's cells, as you breathe out. Each lung has sections called lobes. The left lung has two lobes. The right lung is slightly larger and has three lobes. A thin membrane called the pleura surrounds the lungs. Two tubes called bronchi lead from the trachea (windpipe) to the right and left lungs. Lung cancer may also form in the bronchi. Small tubes called bronchioles and tiny air sacs called alveoli make up the inside of the lungs.
There are two types of lung cancer: small cell lung cancer and non-small cell lung cancer. Small cell lung cancer is less common than non-small cell lung cancer.

The cancer cells of each type grow and spread in different ways. The types of small cell lung cancer are named for the kinds of cells found in the cancer and how the cells look when viewed under a microscope. The cancer cells of each type grow and spread in different ways:
- Small cell carcinoma (also called oat cell cancer) is a type of lung cancer that can grow and spread quickly, often leading to the cancer spreading to other parts of the body early in the disease process. This is the most common type of small cell lung cancer.
- Combined small cell carcinoma is a rare subtype of lung cancer that has characteristics of small cell lung cancer and non-small cell lung cancer in the same tumor.

Lung cancer is caused by certain changes to the way lung cells function, especially how they grow and divide into new cells. There are many risk factors for lung cancer, but many do not directly cause cancer. Instead, they increase the chance of DNA damage in cells that may lead to lung cancer. Learn more about how cancer develops at What Is Cancer?
A risk factor is anything that increases the chance of getting a disease. Some risk factors for lung cancer, like smoking, can be changed. However, risk factors also include things you cannot change, like your genetics, age, and family history. Learning about risk factors for lung cancer can help you make changes that might lower your risk of getting it.

---START CHUNK 1753---
Smoking tobacco now or in the past is the most important risk factor for lung cancer. Smoking cigarettes, pipes, or cigars increases the risk of lung cancer. The earlier in life a person starts smoking, the more often a person smokes, and the more years a person smokes, the greater the risk of lung cancer.
Other risk factors for lung cancer include:
- being exposed to secondhand smoke
- being exposed to asbestos, arsenic, chromium, beryllium, nickel, soot, or tar in the workplace
- being exposed to radiation from:
radiation therapy to the breast or chest
radon in the home or workplace
imaging tests such as CT scans
atomic bomb radiation
- radiation therapy to the breast or chest
- radon in the home or workplace
- imaging tests such as CT scans
- atomic bomb radiation
- living where there is air pollution
- having a family history of lung cancer
- being infected with HIV
- taking beta carotene supplements and being a heavy smoker

---START CHUNK 1754---
- atomic bomb radiation
- living where there is air pollution
- having a family history of lung cancer
- being infected with HIV
- taking beta carotene supplements and being a heavy smoker
Older age is the main risk factor for most cancers. The chance of getting cancer increases as you get older.
Having one or more of these risk factors does not necessarily mean you will get lung cancer. Many people with risk factors never develop lung cancer, whereas others with no known risk factors do. Talk with your doctor if you think you might be at increased risk.
When smoking is combined with other risk factors, the risk of lung cancer is increased.

In addition to asking about your personal and family health history and doing a physical exam, your doctor may perform the following tests and procedures:
- Laboratory tests are medical procedures that test samples of tissue, blood, urine, or other substances in the body. These tests help to diagnose disease, plan and check treatment, or monitor the disease over time.
- Chest x-ray is a type of radiation that can go through the body and make pictures of the organs and bones inside the chest.
ENLARGE
A chest x-ray is used to take pictures of the structures and organs inside the chest. X-rays pass through the patient's body onto film or a computer.

---START CHUNK 1758---
ENLARGE
A chest x-ray is used to take pictures of the structures and organs inside the chest. X-rays pass through the patient's body onto film or a computer.
- CT scan (CAT scan) of the brain, chest, and abdomen uses a computer linked to an x-ray machine to make a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body. The pictures are taken from different angles and are used to create 3-D views of tissues and organs. A dye may be injected into a vein or swallowed to help the organs or tissues show up more clearly. This procedure is also called computed tomography, computerized tomography, or computerized axial tomography.
- Sputum cytology uses a microscope to check for cancer cells in the sputum (mucus coughed up from the lungs).
- Biopsy is the removal of cells or tissues so they can be viewed under a microscope by a pathologist to check for signs of cancer. The different ways a biopsy can be done include the following:

- Biopsy is the removal of cells or tissues so they can be viewed under a microscope by a pathologist to check for signs of cancer. The different ways a biopsy can be done include the following:
Fine-needle aspiration (FNA) biopsy of the lung is the removal of tissue or fluid from the lung, using a thin needle. A CT scan, ultrasound, or other imaging procedure is used to find the abnormal tissue or fluid in the lung. A small incision may be made in the skin where the biopsy needle is inserted into the abnormal tissue or fluid. A sample is removed with the needle and sent to the laboratory. A pathologist then views the sample under a microscope to look for cancer cells. A chest x-ray is done after the procedure to make sure no air is leaking from the lung into the chest.

---START CHUNK 1760---
ENLARGE
Fine-needle aspiration biopsy of the lung. The patient lies on a table that slides through the computed tomography (CT) machine, which takes x-ray pictures of the inside of the body. The x-ray pictures help the doctor see where the abnormal tissue is in the lung. A biopsy needle is inserted through the chest wall and into the area of abnormal lung tissue. A small piece of tissue is removed through the needle and checked under the microscope for signs of cancer.
Bronchoscopy is a procedure to look inside the trachea and large airways in the lung for abnormal areas. A bronchoscope is inserted through the nose or mouth into the trachea and lungs. A bronchoscope is a thin, tube-like instrument with a light and a lens for viewing. It may also have a tool to remove tissue samples, which are checked under a microscope for signs of cancer.

Bronchoscopy. A bronchoscope is inserted through the mouth, trachea, and major bronchi into the lung, to look for abnormal areas. A bronchoscope is a thin, tube-like instrument with a light and a lens for viewing. It may also have a cutting tool. Tissue samples may be taken to be checked under a microscope for signs of disease.
Thoracoscopy is a surgical procedure to look at the organs inside the chest to check for abnormal areas. An incision (cut) is made between two ribs, and a thoracoscope is inserted into the chest. A thoracoscope is a thin, tube-like instrument with a light and a lens for viewing. It may also have a tool to remove tissue or lymph node samples, which are checked under a microscope for signs of cancer. In some cases, this procedure is used to remove part of the esophagus or lung. If certain tissues, organs, or lymph nodes can’t be reached, a thoracotomy may be done. In this procedure, a larger incision is made between the ribs and the chest is opened.

---START CHUNK 1762---
Thoracentesis is the removal of fluid from the space between the lining of the chest and the lung, using a needle. A pathologist views the fluid under a microscope to look for cancer cells.
Mediastinoscopy is a surgical procedure to look at the organs, tissues, and lymph nodes between the lungs for abnormal areas. An incision (cut) is made at the top of the breastbone and a mediastinoscope is inserted into the chest. A mediastinoscope is a thin, tube-like instrument with a light and a lens for viewing. It may also have a tool to remove tissue or lymph node samples, which are checked under a microscope for signs of cancer.

A small incision may be made in the skin where the biopsy needle is inserted into the abnormal tissue or fluid. A sample is removed with the needle and sent to the laboratory. A pathologist then views the sample under a microscope to look for cancer cells. A chest x-ray is done after the procedure to make sure no air is leaking from the lung into the chest.

Fine-needle aspiration biopsy of the lung. The patient lies on a table that slides through the computed tomography (CT) machine, which takes x-ray pictures of the inside of the body. The x-ray pictures help the doctor see where the abnormal tissue is in the lung. A biopsy needle is inserted through the chest wall and into the area of abnormal lung tissue. A small piece of tissue is removed through the needle and checked under the microscope for signs of cancer.
- Bronchoscopy is a procedure to look inside the trachea and large airways in the lung for abnormal areas. A bronchoscope is inserted through the nose or mouth into the trachea and lungs. A bronchoscope is a thin, tube-like instrument with a light and a lens for viewing. It may also have a tool to remove tissue samples, which are checked under a microscope for signs of cancer.

Bronchoscopy. A bronchoscope is inserted through the mouth, trachea, and major bronchi into the lung, to look for abnormal areas. A bronchoscope is a thin, tube-like instrument with a light and a lens for viewing. It may also have a cutting tool. Tissue samples may be taken to be checked under a microscope for signs of disease.
- Thoracoscopy is a surgical procedure to look at the organs inside the chest to check for abnormal areas. An incision (cut) is made between two ribs, and a thoracoscope is inserted into the chest. A thoracoscope is a thin, tube-like instrument with a light and a lens for viewing. It may also have a tool to remove tissue or lymph node samples, which are checked under a microscope for signs of cancer. In some cases, this procedure is used to remove part of the esophagus or lung. If certain tissues, organs, or lymph nodes can’t be reached, a thoracotomy may be done. In this procedure, a larger incision is made between the ribs and the chest is opened.

---START CHUNK 1766---
- Thoracentesis is the removal of fluid from the space between the lining of the chest and the lung, using a needle. A pathologist views the fluid under a microscope to look for cancer cells.
- Mediastinoscopy is a surgical procedure to look at the organs, tissues, and lymph nodes between the lungs for abnormal areas. An incision (cut) is made at the top of the breastbone and a mediastinoscope is inserted into the chest. A mediastinoscope is a thin, tube-like instrument with a light and a lens for viewing. It may also have a tool to remove tissue or lymph node samples, which are checked under a microscope for signs of cancer.

- Immunohistochemistry is a laboratory test that uses antibodies to check for certain antigens (markers) in a sample of a patient’s tissue. The antibodies are usually linked to an enzyme or a fluorescent dye. After the antibodies bind to a specific antigen in the tissue sample, the enzyme or dye is activated, and the antigen can then be seen under a microscope. This type of test is used to help diagnose cancer and to help tell one type of cancer from another type of cancer.

Section: Small Cell Lung Cancer Treatment (PDQ®)–Patient Version > General Information About Small Cell Lung Cancer > After small cell lung cancer has been diagnosed, tests are done to find out if cancer cells have spread within the chest or to other parts of the body.

---START CHUNK 1769---
The process used to find out if cancer has spread within the chest or to other parts of the body is called staging. The information gathered from the staging process determines the stage of the disease. It is important to know the stage in order to plan treatment. Some of the tests used to diagnose small cell lung cancer are also used to stage the disease.
Imaging tests that may be used in the staging process include:
- MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) of the brain uses a magnet, radio waves, and a computer to make a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the brain. This procedure is also called nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (NMRI).

---START CHUNK 1770---
- PET scan (positron emission tomography scan) uses a small amount of radioactive sugar (also called glucose) that is injected into a vein. Then a scanner rotates around the body to make detailed, computerized pictures of areas inside the body where the glucose is taken up. Because cancer cells often take up more glucose than normal cells, the pictures can be used to find cancer cells in the body. A PET scan and CT scan may be done at the same time. This is called a PET-CT.
- Bone scan checks for rapidly dividing cells, such as cancer cells, in the bone. A very small amount of radioactive material is injected into a vein and travels through the bloodstream. The radioactive material collects in the bones with cancer and is detected by a scanner.

Section: Small Cell Lung Cancer Treatment (PDQ®)–Patient Version > General Information About Small Cell Lung Cancer > Some people decide to get a second opinion.

You may want to get a second opinion to confirm your cancer diagnosis and treatment plan. If you seek a second opinion, you will need to get medical test results and reports from the first doctor to share with the second doctor. The second doctor will review the pathology report, slides, and scans. They may agree with the first doctor, suggest changes or another treatment approach, or provide more information about your cancer.
To learn more about choosing a doctor and getting a second opinion, see Finding Cancer Care. You can contact NCI’s Cancer Information Service via chat, email, or phone (both in English and Spanish) for help finding a doctor, hospital, or getting a second opinion.

Section: Small Cell Lung Cancer Treatment (PDQ®)–Patient Version > General Information About Small Cell Lung Cancer > Certain factors affect prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options.

The prognosis and treatment options depend on:
- the stage of the cancer (whether it is in the chest cavity only or has spread to other places in the body)
- the patient’s age, gender, and general health
For certain patients, prognosis also depends on whether the patient is treated with both chemotherapy and radiation.
For most people with small cell lung cancer, current treatments do not cure the cancer. If lung cancer is found, you may want to think about taking part in one of the many clinical trials being done to improve treatment. Clinical trials are taking place in most parts of the country for patients with all stages of small cell lung cancer. Information about ongoing clinical trials is available from the NCI website.

- The following stages are used for small cell lung cancer:
Limited-stage small cell lung cancer
Extensive-stage small cell lung cancer
- Limited-stage small cell lung cancer
- Extensive-stage small cell lung cancer
- Small cell lung cancer can recur (come back) after it has been treated.
Cancer stage describes the extent of cancer in the body, such as the size of the tumor, whether it has spread, and how far it has spread from where it first formed. It is important to know the stage of small cell lung cancer to plan the best treatment.
Small cell lung cancer is usually classified into two stages due to its tendency to spread early.

Recurrent cancer is cancer that has recurred (come back) after it has been treated. If small cell lung cancer comes back, it may come back in the chest, central nervous system, or in other parts of the body. Tests will be done to help determine where the cancer has returned. The type of treatment for small cell lung cancer will depend on where it has come back.

Different types of treatments are available for people with small cell lung cancer. You and your cancer care team will work together to decide your treatment plan, which may include more than one type of treatment. Many factors will be considered, such as the stage of the cancer, your overall health, and your preferences. Your plan will include information about your cancer, the goals of treatment, your treatment options and the possible side effects, and the expected length of treatment.
Talking with your cancer care team before treatment begins about what to expect will be helpful. You’ll want to learn what you need to do before treatment begins, how you’ll feel while going through it, and what kind of help you will need.

Section: Small Cell Lung Cancer Treatment (PDQ®)–Patient Version > Treatment Option Overview > The following types of treatment are used: > Surgery

Surgery may be used if the cancer is found in one lung and in nearby lymph nodes only. Because this type of lung cancer is usually found in both lungs, surgery alone is not often used. During surgery, the doctor will also remove lymph nodes to find out if they have cancer in them. Sometimes, surgery may be used to remove a sample of lung tissue to find out the exact type of lung cancer.
After the doctor removes all the cancer that can be seen at the time of the surgery, some patients may be given chemotherapy or radiation therapy after surgery to kill any cancer cells that are left. Treatment given after the surgery, to lower the risk that the cancer will come back, is called adjuvant therapy.

---START CHUNK 1785---
Chemotherapy (also called chemo) uses drugs to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing.
Chemotherapy for small cell lung cancer is usually systemic, meaning it is injected into a vein or given by mouth. When given this way, the drugs enter the bloodstream to reach cancer cells throughout the body.
Chemotherapy drugs used to treat small cell lung cancer may include:
- carboplatin
- cisplatin
- cyclophosphamide
- doxorubicin
- etoposide
- ifosfamide
- irinotecan
- vincristine
Combinations of these chemotherapy drugs may be used. Other chemotherapy drugs not listed here may also be used.
Chemotherapy may also be combined with other kinds of treatment. For example, it may be combined with radiation therapy or immunotherapy drugs.

Radiation therapy is a cancer treatment that uses high-energy x-rays or other types of radiation to kill cancer cells or keep them from growing. External radiation therapy uses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the area of the body with cancer. External radiation therapy is used to treat small cell lung cancer, and may also be used as palliative therapy to relieve symptoms and improve quality of life. Radiation therapy to the brain to lessen the risk that cancer will spread to the brain may also be given.

Section: Small Cell Lung Cancer Treatment (PDQ®)–Patient Version > About This PDQ Summary > Clinical Trial Information

A clinical trial is a study to answer a scientific question, such as whether one treatment is better than another. Trials are based on past studies and what has been learned in the laboratory. Each trial answers certain scientific questions in order to find new and better ways to help cancer patients. During treatment clinical trials, information is collected about the effects of a new treatment and how well it works. If a clinical trial shows that a new treatment is better than one currently being used, the new treatment may become "standard." Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment.
Clinical trials can be found online at NCI's website. For more information, call the Cancer Information Service (CIS), NCI's contact center, at 1-800-4-CANCER (1-800-422-6237).

Section: What Is Lung Cancer? > Normal structure and function of the lungs

---START CHUNK 1816---
Your lungs are 2 sponge-like organs in your chest that are separated into sections called lobes. Your right lung has 3 lobes. Your left lung has 2 lobes. The left lung is smaller because the heart takes up more room on that side of the body.
When you inhale (breathe in), air enters through your mouth or nose and goes into your lungs through the trachea (windpipe). The trachea divides into tubes called bronchi, which enter the lungs and divide into smaller bronchi. These divide to form smaller branches called bronchioles. At the end of the bronchioles are tiny air sacs known as alveoli.
The alveoli absorb oxygen into your blood from the inhaled air and remove carbon dioxide from the blood when you exhale (breathe out). Taking in oxygen and getting rid of carbon dioxide are your lungs’ main functions.

---START CHUNK 1817---
A thin lining layer called the pleura surrounds the lungs. The pleura protects your lungs and helps them slide back and forth against the chest wall as they expand and contract during breathing.
Below the lungs, a thin, dome-shaped muscle called the diaphragm separates the chest from the abdomen. When you breathe, the diaphragm moves up and down, forcing air in and out of the lungs.

Section: What Is Lung Cancer? > Types of lung cancer

The main types of lung cancer are: non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and small cell lung cancer (SCLC).

Section: What Is Lung Cancer? > Types of lung cancer > Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)

---START CHUNK 1822---
About 80% to 85% of lung cancers are NSCLC. The main subtypes of NSCLC are adenocarcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, and large cell carcinoma. These subtypes, which start from different types of lung cells, are grouped together as NSCLC because their treatment and prognoses (outlooks) are often similar.
Adenocarcinoma: Lung adenocarcinoma starts in  cells in the lung that make mucus, called epithelial cells. Epithelial cells line the surface of the lungs. Adenocarcinoma is the most common type of non-small cell lung cancer
Lung adenocarcinoma occurs mainly in people who smoke or used to smoke, but it is also the most common type of lung cancer seen in people who don’t smoke. It is more common in women than in men, and it is more likely to occur in younger people than other types of lung cancer.

---START CHUNK 1823---
Squamous cell carcinoma: Squamous cell carcinoma starts in squamous cells, which are flat cells that line the inside of the airways in the lungs. They are often linked to a history of smoking and tend to be found in the central part of the lungs, near a main airway (bronchus).
Large cell (undifferentiated) carcinoma: Large cell carcinoma can appear in any part of the lung. It tends to grow and spread quickly, which can make it harder to treat. A subtype of large cell carcinoma, known as large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma (LCNEC), is a fast-growing cancer that is very similar to small cell lung cancer.
Other subtypes: A few other subtypes of NSCLC, such as adenosquamous carcinoma and sarcomatoid carcinoma, are much less common.

Section: What Is Lung Cancer? > Types of lung cancer > Small cell lung cancer (SCLC)

About 10% to 15% of all lung cancers are SCLC.
This type of lung cancer tends to grow and spread faster than NSCLC. In most people with SCLC, the cancer has already spread beyond the lungs at the time it is diagnosed. Since this cancer grows quickly, it tends to respond well to chemotherapy and radiation therapy. Unfortunately, for most people the cancer will return at some point.

Section: What Is Lung Cancer? > Other types of lung tumors

---START CHUNK 1826---
Along with the main types of lung cancer, other tumors can develop in the lungs.
Lung carcinoid tumors: Carcinoid tumors of the lung account for fewer than 5% of lung tumors. Most of these grow slowly. For more information about these tumors, see Lung Carcinoid Tumor.
Other lung tumors: Other types of lung cancer, such as adenoid cystic carcinomas, lymphomas, and sarcomas, as well as benign lung tumors such as hamartomas, are rare. These are treated differently from the more common lung cancers and are not discussed here.
Cancers that spread to the lungs: Cancers that start in other organs (such as the breast, pancreas, kidney, or skin) can sometimes spread (metastasize) to the lungs, but these are not lung cancers. For example, cancer that starts in the breast and spreads to the lungs is still breast cancer, not lung cancer. Treatment for metastatic cancer to the lungs is based on where it started (the primary cancer site).

Section: Small Cell Lung Cancer Stages

After someone is diagnosed with small cell lung cancer (SCLC), doctors will try to figure out if it has spread, and if so, how far. This process is called staging. The stage of a cancer describes where the cancer is in the body. It helps determine how best to treat it. Doctors also use a cancer’s stage when talking about survival statistics.

Title: Small Cell Lung Cancer Stages

Author: American Cancer Society

Section: Small Cell Lung Cancer Stages > How is the stage determined?

The stage of SCLC is based on the results of physical exams, biopsies, imaging tests, and any other tests that have been done (as described in Tests for Lung Cancer).

Section: Small Cell Lung Cancer Stages > Limited versus extensive stage

For treatment purposes, most doctors use a 2-stage system that divides SCLC into limited stage and extensive stage. For limited-stage cancer, a person might benefit from more aggressive treatments such as chemotherapy combined with radiation therapy to try to cure the cancer. For extensive-stage disease, chemotherapy in combination with immunotherapy is likely to be a better option to control (not cure) the cancer.

---START CHUNK 1842---
Section: Small Cell Lung Cancer Stages > Limited versus extensive stage > Limited stage

This means that the cancer is only on one side of the chest and can be treated with a single radiation field. This generally includes cancers that are only in one lung, and that might also have reached the lymph nodes on the same side of the chest.
Cancer in lymph nodes above the collarbone (called supraclavicular nodes) might still be considered limited stage as long as they are on the same side of the chest as the cancer. Some doctors also include lymph nodes at the center of the chest (mediastinal lymph nodes) even when they are closer to the other side of the chest.
What is important is that the cancer is confined to an area that is small enough to be treated with radiation therapy in one treatment area. Only about 1 out of 3 people with SCLC have limited-stage cancer when it is first found.

Section: Small Cell Lung Cancer Stages > Limited versus extensive stage > Extensive stage

This describes cancers that have spread widely throughout the lung, to the other lung, or to other parts of the body (including the bone marrow). Many doctors consider SCLC that has spread to the fluid around the lung and/or heart to be extensive stage as well. About 2 out of 3 people with SCLC have extensive disease when their cancer is first found.

Section: Small Cell Lung Cancer Stages > The TNM staging system

---START CHUNK 1845---
A more formal system to describe the growth and spread of lung cancer is the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) TNM staging system, which is based on 3 key pieces of information:
- The size and extent of the main tumor (T): How large is the tumor? Has it grown into nearby structures or organs?
- The spread to nearby (regional) lymph nodes (N): Has the cancer spread to nearby lymph nodes?
- The spread (metastasis) (M) to other organs of the body: Has the cancer spread to distant organs such as the brain, bones, adrenal glands, liver, or the other lung?
Numbers or letters appear after T, N, and M to provide more details about each of these factors. Higher numbers mean the cancer is more advanced. Once the T, N, and M categories have been determined, this information is combined in a process called stage grouping, to assign an overall stage. For more information, see Cancer Staging.

---START CHUNK 1846---
In the TNM system, the earliest stage is stage 0 (also called carcinoma in situ, or CIS). The other main stages range from I (1) through IV (4). Some of these stages are broken down further with letters or numbers. As a rule, the lower the stage number, the less the cancer has spread. A higher number, such as stage IV, means cancer has spread more. And within a stage, an earlier letter (or number) means a lower stage.
The same TNM staging system is used for both SCLC and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), although it’s generally not as important for SCLC. For more detailed information about this system, see Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Stages. Staging with the TNM system can be complex, so if your health care team is using it, ask them to explain it to you in a way you understand.

---START CHUNK 1860---
This process is called staging. The stage of a cancer describes how much and where the cancer is in the body. It helps determine how best to treat it. Doctors also use a cancer’s stage when talking about survival statistics.
The earliest stage of NSCLC is stage 0 (also called carcinoma in situ, or CIS). Other stages range from I (1) through IV (4). As a rule, the lower the number, the less the cancer has spread. A higher number, such as stage IV, means cancer has spread more. And within a stage, an earlier letter (or number) means a lower stage. Although each person’s cancer experience is unique, cancers with similar stages tend to have a similar outlook and are often treated in much the same way.
The staging system most often used for NSCLC is the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) TNM system, which is based on 3 key pieces of information:
- The size and extent of the main tumor (T): How large is the tumor? Has it grown into nearby structures or organs?

---START CHUNK 1861---
- The size and extent of the main tumor (T): How large is the tumor? Has it grown into nearby structures or organs?
- The spread to nearby lymph nodes (N): Has the cancer spread to nearby lymph nodes? (See image.)
- The spread (metastasis) to distant sites (M): Has the cancer spread to distant organs, such as the brain, bones, adrenal glands, liver, the pleural fluid, or the other lung?
Numbers or letters after T, N, and M provide more details about each of these factors. Higher numbers mean the cancer is more advanced. Once a person’s T, N, and M categories have been determined, this information is combined in a process called stage grouping to assign an overall stage. For more information, see Cancer Staging.
The system described below is the most recent version of the AJCC system, effective as of January 2018.

---START CHUNK 1862---
The system described below is the most recent version of the AJCC system, effective as of January 2018.
NSCLC is typically given a clinical stage based on the results of a physical exam, biopsy, and imaging tests (as described in Tests for Lung Cancer). If surgery is done, the pathologic stage (also called the surgical stage) is determined by examining tissue removed during the operation.
Staging for NSCLC can be complex, so ask your doctor to explain it to you in a way you understand.

- Non-small cell lung cancer is a type of cancer that forms in the tissues of the lung.
- There are several types of non-small cell lung cancer.
- Smoking is the major risk factor for non-small cell lung cancer.
- Signs and symptoms of non-small cell lung cancer include coughing and shortness of breath.
- Tests that examine the lungs are used to diagnose and stage non-small cell lung cancer.
- If lung cancer is suspected, you will have a biopsy.
- After non-small cell lung cancer has been diagnosed, tests are done to find out if cancer cells have spread within the chest or to other parts of the body.
- Some people decide to get a second opinion.
- Certain factors affect prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options.

The lungs are a pair of cone-shaped breathing organs in the chest. The lungs bring oxygen into the body as you breathe in. They release carbon dioxide, a waste product of the body's cells, as you breathe out. Each lung has sections called lobes. The left lung has two lobes. The right lung is slightly larger and has three lobes. Two tubes called bronchi lead from the trachea (windpipe) to the right and left lungs. Lung cancer may also form in the bronchi. Tiny air sacs called alveoli and small tubes called bronchioles make up the inside of the lungs.
A thin membrane called the pleura covers the outside of each lung and lines the inside wall of the chest cavity. This creates a sac called the pleural cavity. The pleural cavity normally contains a small amount of fluid that helps the lungs move smoothly in the chest when you breathe.

There are two main types of lung cancer: non-small cell lung cancer and small cell lung cancer. Non-small cell lung cancer is more common than small cell lung cancer.

---START CHUNK 1899---
Each type of non-small cell lung cancer has different kinds of cancer cells. The cancer cells of each type grow and spread in different ways. The types of non-small cell lung cancer are named for the kinds of cells found in the cancer and how the cells look under a microscope:
- Squamous cell carcinoma is a type of lung cancer that forms in the thin, flat cells lining the inside of the lungs. This is also called epidermoid carcinoma.
- Large cell carcinoma is a type of lung cancer that may begin in several types of large cells.
- Adenocarcinoma is a type of lung cancer that begins in the cells that line the alveoli and make substances such as mucus.
Less common types of non-small cell lung cancer include adenosquamous carcinoma, sarcomatoid carcinoma, salivary gland carcinoma, carcinoid tumor, and unclassified carcinoma.

---START CHUNK 1901---
Lung cancer is caused by certain changes to the way lung cells function, especially how they grow and divide into new cells. There are many risk factors for lung cancer, but many do not directly cause cancer. Instead, they increase the chance of DNA damage in cells that may lead to lung cancer. Learn more about how cancer develops at What Is Cancer?
A risk factor is anything that increases the chance of getting a disease. Some risk factors for lung cancer, like smoking, can be changed. However, risk factors also include things you cannot change, like your genetics, age, and family history. Learning about risk factors for lung cancer can help you make changes that might lower your risk of getting it.

---START CHUNK 1902---
Smoking tobacco now or in the past is the most important risk factor for lung cancer. Smoking cigarettes, pipes, or cigars increases the risk of lung cancer. The earlier in life a person starts smoking, the more often a person smokes, and the more years a person smokes, the greater the risk of lung cancer.
Other risk factors for lung cancer include:
- being exposed to secondhand smoke
- being exposed to asbestos, arsenic, chromium, beryllium, nickel, soot, or tar in the workplace
- being exposed to radiation from:
radiation therapy to the breast or chest
radon in the home or workplace
imaging tests such as CT scans
atomic bomb radiation
- radiation therapy to the breast or chest
- radon in the home or workplace
- imaging tests such as CT scans
- atomic bomb radiation
- living where there is air pollution
- having a family history of lung cancer
- being infected with HIV
- taking beta carotene supplements and being a heavy smoker

---START CHUNK 1903---
- atomic bomb radiation
- living where there is air pollution
- having a family history of lung cancer
- being infected with HIV
- taking beta carotene supplements and being a heavy smoker
Older age is the main risk factor for most cancers. The chance of getting cancer increases as you get older.
Having one or more of these risk factors does not necessarily mean you will get lung cancer. Many people with risk factors never develop lung cancer, whereas others with no known risk factors do. Talk with your doctor if you think you might be at increased risk.
When smoking is combined with other risk factors, the risk of lung cancer is increased.

---START CHUNK 1906---
Non-small cell lung cancer is usually diagnosed with tests and procedures that make pictures of the lung and the area around it. The process used to find out if cancer cells have spread within and around the lung is called staging. Tests and procedures to detect, diagnose, and stage non-small cell lung cancer are usually done at the same time. To plan treatment, it is important to know the stage of the disease and whether the cancer can be removed by surgery.
In addition to asking about your personal and family health history and doing a physical exam, your doctor may perform the following tests and procedures:
- Laboratory tests are medical procedures that test samples of tissue, blood, urine, or other substances in the body. These tests help to diagnose disease, plan and check treatment, or monitor the disease over time.
- Chest x-ray is a type of radiation that can go through the body and make pictures of the organs and bones inside the chest.

A chest x-ray is used to take pictures of the structures and organs inside the chest. X-rays pass through the patient's body onto film or a computer.
- CT scan (CAT scan) of the brain, chest, and abdomen uses a computer linked to an x-ray machine to make a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body. The pictures are taken from different angles and are used to create 3-D views of tissues and organs. A dye may be injected into a vein or swallowed to help the organs or tissues show up more clearly. This procedure is also called computed tomography, computerized tomography, or computerized axial tomography.

---START CHUNK 1909---
You may have one of the following types of biopsies:
- Fine-needle aspiration (FNA) biopsy of the lung is the removal of tissue or fluid from the lung using a thin needle. A CT scan, ultrasound, or other imaging procedure is used to locate the abnormal tissue or fluid in the lung. A small incision may be made in the skin where the biopsy needle is inserted into the abnormal tissue or fluid. A sample is removed with the needle and sent to the laboratory. A pathologist then views the sample under a microscope to look for cancer cells. A chest x-ray is done after the procedure to make sure no air is leaking from the lung into the chest.
ENLARGE

---START CHUNK 1910---
ENLARGE
Fine-needle aspiration biopsy of the lung. The patient lies on a table that slides through the computed tomography (CT) machine, which takes x-ray pictures of the inside of the body. The x-ray pictures help the doctor see where the abnormal tissue is in the lung. A biopsy needle is inserted through the chest wall and into the area of abnormal lung tissue. A small piece of tissue is removed through the needle and checked under the microscope for signs of cancer.
An endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) is a type of ultrasound that may be used to guide an FNA biopsy of the lung, lymph nodes, or other areas. EUS is a procedure in which an endoscope is inserted into the body. An endoscope is a thin, tube-like instrument with a light and a lens for viewing. A probe at the end of the endoscope is used to bounce high-energy sound waves (ultrasound) off internal tissues or organs and make echoes. The echoes form a picture of body tissues called a sonogram.

Endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration biopsy. An endoscope that has an ultrasound probe and a biopsy needle is inserted through the mouth and into the esophagus. The probe bounces sound waves off body tissues to make echoes that form a sonogram (computer picture) of the lymph nodes near the esophagus. The sonogram helps the doctor see where to place the biopsy needle to remove tissue from the lymph nodes. This tissue is checked under a microscope for signs of cancer.

Tissue samples may be taken to be checked under a microscope for signs of disease.

---START CHUNK 1913---
- Thoracoscopy is a surgical procedure to look at the organs inside the chest to check for abnormal areas. An incision (cut) is made between two ribs, and a thoracoscope is inserted into the chest. A thoracoscope is a thin, tube-like instrument with a light and a lens for viewing. It may also have a tool to remove tissue or lymph node samples, which are checked under a microscope for signs of cancer. In some cases, this procedure is used to remove part of the esophagus or lung. If certain tissues, organs, or lymph nodes can't be reached, a thoracotomy may be done. In this procedure, a larger incision is made between the ribs and the chest is opened.
- Thoracentesis is the removal of fluid from the space between the lining of the chest and the lung using a needle. A pathologist views the fluid under a microscope to look for cancer cells.

---START CHUNK 1914---
- Thoracentesis is the removal of fluid from the space between the lining of the chest and the lung using a needle. A pathologist views the fluid under a microscope to look for cancer cells.

An incision (cut) is made at the top of the breastbone and a mediastinoscope is inserted into the chest. A mediastinoscope is a thin, tube-like instrument with a light and a lens for viewing. It may also have a tool to remove tissue or lymph node samples, which are checked under a microscope for signs of cancer.

---START CHUNK 1915---
- Anterior mediastinotomy is a surgical procedure to look at the organs and tissues between the lungs and between the breastbone and heart for abnormal areas. An incision (cut) is made next to the breastbone and a mediastinoscope is inserted into the chest. A mediastinoscope is a thin, tube-like instrument with a light and a lens for viewing. It may also have a tool to remove tissue or lymph node samples, which are checked under a microscope for signs of cancer. This is also called the Chamberlain procedure.
- Lymph node biopsy is the removal of all or part of a lymph node. A pathologist views the lymph node tissue under a microscope to check for cancer cells. A lymph node biopsy may be done at the same time as other types of biopsies.
One or more of the following laboratory tests may be done to study the tissue from the biopsy:

---START CHUNK 1916---
One or more of the following laboratory tests may be done to study the tissue from the biopsy:
- Molecular tests check for certain genes, proteins, or other molecules in a sample of tissue, blood, or other body fluid. Molecular tests check for certain gene or chromosome changes that occur in non-small cell lung cancer.
- Immunohistochemistry uses antibodies to check for certain antigens (markers) in a sample of a patient's tissue. The antibodies are usually linked to an enzyme or a fluorescent dye. After the antibodies bind to a specific antigen in the tissue sample, the enzyme or dye is activated, and the antigen can then be seen under a microscope. This type of test is used to help diagnose cancer and to help tell one type of cancer from another type of cancer.

Section: Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Treatment (PDQ®)–Patient Version > General Information About Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer > After non-small cell lung cancer has been diagnosed, tests are done to find out if cancer cells have spread within the chest or to other parts of the body.

---START CHUNK 1918---
The process used to find out if cancer has spread within the chest or to other parts of the body is called staging. The information gathered from the staging process determines the stage of the disease. It is important to know the stage in order to plan treatment. Some of the tests used to diagnose non-small cell lung cancer are also used to stage the disease.
Imaging tests that may be used in the staging process include:
- MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) of the brain uses a magnet, radio waves, and a computer to make a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the brain. This procedure is also called nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (NMRI).

---START CHUNK 1919---
- PET scan (positron emission tomography scan) uses a small amount of radioactive sugar (also called glucose) that is injected into a vein. Then a scanner rotates around the body to make detailed, computerized pictures of areas inside the body where the glucose is taken up. Because cancer cells often take up more glucose than normal cells, the pictures can be used to find cancer cells in the body. A PET scan and CT scan may be done at the same time. This is called a PET-CT.
- Bone scan checks for cancer cells in the bone. A very small amount of radioactive material is injected into a vein and travels through the bloodstream. The radioactive material collects in the bones with cancer and is detected by a scanner.

---START CHUNK 1920---
- Pulmonary function test (PFT) checks how well the lungs are working. It measures how much air the lungs can hold and how quickly air moves into and out of the lungs. It also measures how much oxygen is used and how much carbon dioxide is given off during breathing. This is also called lung function test.
- Bone marrow aspiration and biopsy is the removal of bone marrow, blood, and a small piece of bone by inserting a hollow needle into the hipbone or breastbone. A pathologist views the bone marrow, blood, and bone under a microscope to look for signs of cancer.

You may want to get a second opinion to confirm your non-small cell lung cancer diagnosis and treatment plan. If you seek a second opinion, you will need to get medical test results and reports from the first doctor to share with the second doctor. The second doctor will review the pathology report, slides, and scans. They may agree with the first doctor, suggest changes or another treatment approach, or provide more information about your cancer.
To learn more about choosing a doctor and getting a second opinion, see Finding Cancer Care.

---START CHUNK 1924---
The prognosis and treatment options depend on:
- the stage of the cancer (the size of the tumor and whether it is in the lung only or has spread to other places in the body)
- the type of lung cancer
- whether the cancer has mutations (changes) in certain genes, such as the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene or the anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) gene
- whether there are signs and symptoms such as coughing or trouble breathing
- your general health
For most people with non-small cell lung cancer, current treatments do not cure the cancer. If lung cancer is found, you may want to think about taking part in one of the many clinical trials being done to improve treatment or quality of life. Clinical trials are taking place in most parts of the country for people with all stages of non-small cell lung cancer. Information about ongoing clinical trials is available at Clinical Trials Information for Patients and Caregivers.

- Stage III (also called stage 3) non-small cell lung cancer
- Stage IV (also called stage 4) non-small cell lung cancer
- Non-small cell lung cancer can recur (come back) after it has been treated.
Cancer stage describes the extent of cancer in the body, such as the size of the tumor, whether it has spread, and how far it has spread from where it first formed. It is important to know the stage of non-small cell lung cancer to plan the best treatment.

---START CHUNK 1927---
There are several staging systems for cancer that describe the extent of the cancer. Non-small cell lung cancer staging usually uses the TNM staging system. The cancer may be described by this staging system in your pathology report. Based on the TNM results, a stage (I, II, III, or IV, also written as 1, 2, 3, or 4) is assigned to your cancer. When talking to you about your diagnosis, your doctor may describe the cancer as one of these stages.

Section: Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Treatment (PDQ®)–Patient Version > Stages of Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer > Non-small cell lung cancer can recur (come back) after it has been treated.

Recurrent non-small cell lung cancer is cancer that has come back after it has been treated. If non-small cell lung cancer comes back, it may come back in the brain, lung, chest, or in other parts of the body. Tests will be done to help determine where the cancer has returned. The type of treatment for non-small cell lung cancer will depend on where it has come back.

Different types of treatments are available for people with non-small cell lung cancer. You and your cancer care team will work together to decide your treatment plan, which may include more than one type of treatment. Many factors will be considered, such as the stage of the cancer, your overall health, and your preferences. Your plan will include information about your cancer, the goals of treatment, your treatment options and the possible side effects, and the expected length of treatment.
Talking with your cancer care team before treatment begins about what to expect will be helpful. You'll want to learn what you need to do before treatment begins, how you'll feel while going through it, and what kind of help you will need. To learn more, see Questions to Ask Your Doctor About Treatment.

---START CHUNK 1967---
Four types of surgery are used to treat lung cancer:
- Wedge resection is surgery to remove a tumor and some of the normal tissue around it. When a slightly larger amount of tissue is taken, it is called a segmental resection.
ENLARGE
Wedge resection of the lung. Part of the lung lobe containing the cancer and a small amount of healthy tissue around it is removed.
- Lobectomy is surgery to remove a whole lobe (section) of the lung.
ENLARGE
Lobectomy. A lobe of the lung is removed.
- Pneumonectomy is surgery to remove one whole lung.
ENLARGE
Pneumonectomy. The whole lung is removed.
- Sleeve resection is surgery to remove part of the bronchus.
After the doctor removes all the cancer that can be seen at the time of the surgery, some people may be given chemotherapy or radiation therapy after surgery to kill any cancer cells that are left. Treatment given after the surgery to lower the risk that the cancer will come back is called adjuvant therapy.

Section: Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Treatment (PDQ®)–Patient Version > Treatment Option Overview > The following types of treatment are used: > Radiation therapy

---START CHUNK 1969---
Radiation therapy is a cancer treatment that uses high-energy x-rays or other types of radiation to kill cancer cells or keep them from growing. There are two types of radiation therapy:
- External radiation therapy uses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the area of the body with cancer.
- Internal radiation therapy uses a radioactive substance sealed in needles, seeds, wires, or catheters that are placed directly into or near the cancer.
Stereotactic body radiation therapy is a type of external radiation therapy. Special equipment is used to ensure you are in the same position for each radiation treatment. Once a day for several days, a radiation machine aims a larger than usual dose of radiation directly at the tumor. By having you in the same position for each treatment, there is less damage to nearby healthy tissue. This procedure is also called stereotactic external beam radiation therapy and stereotaxic radiation therapy.

---START CHUNK 1970---
Stereotactic radiosurgery is a type of external radiation therapy used to treat lung cancer that has spread to the brain. A rigid head frame is attached to the skull to keep the head still during the radiation treatment. A machine aims a single large dose of radiation directly at the tumor in the brain. This procedure does not involve surgery. It is also called stereotaxic radiosurgery, radiosurgery, and radiation surgery.
For tumors in the airways, radiation is given directly to the tumor through an endoscope.
The way the radiation therapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated. It also depends on where the cancer is found. External and internal radiation therapy are used to treat non-small cell lung cancer.

---START CHUNK 1972---
Chemotherapy (also called chemo) uses drugs to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing.
Chemotherapy for non-small cell lung cancer is usually systemic, meaning it is injected into a vein or given by mouth. When given this way, the drugs enter the bloodstream to reach cancer cells throughout the body.
Chemotherapy drugs used to treat non-small cell lung cancer may include:
- carboplatin
- cisplatin
- docetaxel
- doxorubicin
- etoposide
- gemcitabine
- paclitaxel
- pemetrexed
- vinorelbine
Combinations of these chemotherapy drugs may be used. Other chemotherapy drugs not listed here may also be used.
Chemotherapy may also be combined with other kinds of treatment. For example, it may be combined with radiation therapy or immunotherapy drugs.

Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is a cancer treatment that uses a drug and a certain type of laser light to kill cancer cells. A drug that is not active until it is exposed to light is injected into a vein. The drug collects more in cancer cells than in normal cells. Fiberoptic tubes are then used to carry the laser light to the cancer cells, where the drug becomes active and kills the cells. Photodynamic therapy causes little damage to healthy tissue. It is used mainly to treat tumors on or just under the skin or in the lining of internal organs. When the tumor is in the airways, PDT is given directly to the tumor through an endoscope.

Section: Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Treatment (PDQ®)–Patient Version > Treatment Option Overview > New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials.

For some people, joining a clinical trial may be an option. There are different types of clinical trials for people with cancer. For example, a treatment trial tests new treatments or new ways of using current treatments. Supportive care and palliative care trials look at ways to improve quality of life, especially for those who have side effects from cancer and its treatment.
You can use the clinical trial search to find NCI-supported cancer clinical trials accepting participants. The search allows you to filter trials based on the type of cancer, your age, and where the trials are being done. Clinical trials supported by other organizations can be found on the ClinicalTrials.gov website.
Learn more about clinical trials, including how to find and join one, at Clinical Trials Information for Patients and Caregivers.

Section: Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Treatment (PDQ®)–Patient Version > Treatment Option Overview > Follow-up care may be needed.

As you go through treatment, you will have follow-up tests or check-ups. Some tests that were done to diagnose or stage the cancer may be repeated to see how well the treatment is working. Decisions about whether to continue, change, or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests.
Some of the tests will continue to be done from time to time after treatment has ended. The results of these tests can show if your condition has changed or if the cancer has recurred (come back).

---START CHUNK 2005---
Physician Data Query (PDQ) is the National Cancer Institute's (NCI's) comprehensive cancer information database. The PDQ database contains summaries of the latest published information on cancer prevention, detection, genetics, treatment, supportive care, and complementary and alternative medicine. Most summaries come in two versions. The health professional versions have detailed information written in technical language. The patient versions are written in easy-to-understand, nontechnical language. Both versions have cancer information that is accurate and up to date and most versions are also available in Spanish.
PDQ is a service of the NCI. The NCI is part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH). NIH is the federal government’s center of biomedical research. The PDQ summaries are based on an independent review of the medical literature. They are not policy statements of the NCI or the NIH.

Section: Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Treatment (PDQ®)–Patient Version > About This PDQ Summary > Clinical Trial Information

A clinical trial is a study to answer a scientific question, such as whether one treatment is better than another. Trials are based on past studies and what has been learned in the laboratory. Each trial answers certain scientific questions in order to find new and better ways to help cancer patients. During treatment clinical trials, information is collected about the effects of a new treatment and how well it works. If a clinical trial shows that a new treatment is better than one currently being used, the new treatment may become "standard." Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment.
Clinical trials can be found online at NCI's website. For more information, call the Cancer Information Service (CIS), NCI's contact center, at 1-800-4-CANCER (1-800-422-6237).

Section: Palliative Procedures for Small Cell Lung Cancer > Options for palliative support

People with small cell lung cancer (SCLC) often benefit from procedures to help with problems caused by the cancer. For example, people with advanced lung cancer can be short of breath. This can be caused by many things, including fluid around the lung or an airway that is blocked by a tumor. Although treating the cancer with chemotherapy or other drugs may help with this over time, other treatments may be needed as well.

Section: Palliative Procedures for Small Cell Lung Cancer > Treating fluid buildup in the area around the lung > Pleurodesis

Pleurodesis is a procedure to remove the fluid and keep it from coming back. The main types are:
Chemical pleurodesis: A small cut is made in the skin of the chest wall, and a hollow tube (called a chest tube) is placed into the chest to remove the fluid. Then a substance is put into the chest through the tube that causes the linings of the lung (visceral pleura) and chest wall (parietal pleura) to stick together, sealing the space and limiting further fluid buildup. A number of substances can be used for this, such as talc, the antibiotic doxycycline, or a chemotherapy drug like bleomycin.
Surgical pleurodesis: Talc is blown into the space around the lungs during an operation. This is done through a small incision using thoracoscopy

For this technique, a light-activated drug called porfimer sodium (Photofrin) is injected into a vein. This drug collects more in cancer cells than in normal cells. After a couple of days (to give the drug time to build up in the cancer cells), a bronchoscope is passed down the throat and into the lung. This can be done using either local anesthesia (numbing the throat) and sedation, or with general anesthesia (which puts you in a deep sleep). A special laser light on the end of the bronchoscope is aimed at the tumor, which activates the drug and kills the cells. The dead cells are then removed a few days later during a bronchoscopy. This process can be repeated if needed.

---START CHUNK 2033---
PDT can cause swelling in the airway for a few days, which could lead to some shortness of breath, as well as coughing up blood or thick mucus. Some of this drug also collects in normal cells in the body, such as skin and eye cells. This can make you very sensitive to sunlight or strong indoor lights. Too much exposure can cause serious skin reactions (like a severe sunburn), so doctors recommend staying out of any strong light for several weeks after the injection.

Lasers can sometimes be used to help open up airways blocked by tumors to help people breathe better.
The laser is on the end of a bronchoscope, which is passed down the throat and next to the tumor. The doctor then aims the laser beam at the tumor to burn it away. This treatment can usually be repeated, if needed. You are usually asleep (under general anesthesia) for this type of treatment.

If a lung tumor has grown into an airway and is causing problems, sometimes a bronchoscope is used to put a hard silicone or metal tube called a stent in the airway to help keep it open. This is often done after other treatments such as PDT or laser therapy.

Chemotherapy (chemo) is treatment with anti-cancer drugs that may be injected into a vein or taken by mouth.

Section: Chemotherapy for Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer > When is chemotherapy used?

---START CHUNK 2050---
Chemotherapy travels through the bloodstream and reaches most parts of the body. Not all people with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) will need chemo, but depending on the cancer’s stage and other factors, chemo may be recommended in different situations:
- Before surgery (neoadjuvant chemotherapy): Neoadjuvant chemo may be used (sometimes with radiation therapy) to try to shrink a tumor to make it easier to remove it with less extensive surgery.
- After surgery (adjuvant chemotherapy): Adjuvant chemo may be used (sometimes with radiation therapy) to try to kill any cancer cells that might have been left behind or have spread but can’t be seen on imaging tests.
- For locally advanced NSCLC: Sometimes, chemo along with radiation therapy is given as the main treatment for more advanced cancers that have grown into nearby structures if surgery is not an option or for people who aren’t healthy enough for surgery.

---START CHUNK 2051---
- For metastatic (stage IV) NSCLC: Chemo may be given for lung cancer that has spread to areas outside the lung, such as the bones, liver, or adrenal gland.
Chemo is often not recommended for patients in poor health, but advanced age by itself is not a barrier to getting chemo.

Section: Chemotherapy for Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer > Chemotherapy drugs used to treat NSCLC

---START CHUNK 2053---
Section: Chemotherapy for Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer > Chemotherapy drugs used to treat NSCLC

The chemo drugs most often used for NSCLC include:
- Cisplatin
- Carboplatin
- Paclitaxel (Taxol)
- Albumin-bound paclitaxel (nab-paclitaxel, Abraxane)
- Docetaxel (Taxotere)
- Gemcitabine (Gemzar)
- Vinorelbine (Navelbine)
- Etoposide (VP-16)
- Pemetrexed (Alimta)
Combinations of 2 chemo drugs are often used to treat early-stage lung cancer. If a combination is used, it often includes cisplatin or carboplatin plus one other drug.
Advanced lung cancer though may be treated with a single chemo drug especially in people who might not tolerate combination chemotherapy well, such as those in poor overall health or who are elderly.
For some people, a targeted therapy drug or an immunotherapy drug may be given alone or with chemotherapy. For more on this, see Treatment Choices for Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer, by Stage.

Section: Chemotherapy for Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer > How is chemotherapy given?

---START CHUNK 2055---
Chemo drugs for lung cancer are typically given into a vein (IV), either as an injection over a few minutes or as an infusion over a longer period of time. This can be done in a doctor’s office, chemotherapy clinic, or in a hospital setting.
Often, a slightly larger and sturdier IV is required in the vein system to administer chemo. They are known as central venous catheters (CVCs), central venous access devices (CVADs), or central lines. They are used to put medicines, blood products, nutrients, or fluids right into your blood. They can also be used to take out blood for testing.
Many different kinds of CVCs are available. The most common types are the port and the PICC (peripherally inserted central catheter) line.
A port is a small quarter-sized device that is placed under the skin in your upper chest. A small tube connects the port to a large vein that goes into the heart, called the superior vena cava.

---START CHUNK 2056---
A port is a small quarter-sized device that is placed under the skin in your upper chest. A small tube connects the port to a large vein that goes into the heart, called the superior vena cava.
A PICC line is a small tube that is placed in the upper arm; that tube threads through the vein until reaches the superior vena cava.
Chemo is given in cycles. Each cycle includes the period of treatment followed by a rest period to give you time to recover from the effects of the drugs. Cycles are most often 3 or 4 weeks long. The schedule varies depending on the drugs used. For example, with some drugs, the chemo is given only on the first day of the cycle. With others, it is given for a few days in a row, or once a week. Then, at the end of the cycle, the chemo schedule repeats to start the next cycle.

---START CHUNK 2057---
Adjuvant and neoadjuvant chemo is often given for 3 to 4 months, depending on the drugs used. The length of treatment for advanced lung cancer is based on how well it is working and what side effects you have.
For advanced cancers, the initial chemo combination is often given for 4 to 6 cycles. Some doctors now recommend giving treatment beyond this with a single chemo or targeted drug, in people who have responded well to their initial chemotherapy or have had no worsening of their cancer. Continuing this treatment, known as maintenance therapy, seems to help keep the cancer in check and help some people live longer.
If the initial chemo treatment for advanced lung cancer is no longer working, the doctor may recommend second-line treatment with chemo, targeted therapy, immunotherapy, or a clinical trial.

Section: Chemotherapy for Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer > Possible side effects of chemo for NSCLC

---START CHUNK 2059---
Chemo drugs can cause side effects. These depend on the type and dose of drugs given and how long they are taken. Some common side effects include:
- Hair loss
- Mouth sores
- Loss of appetite and weight loss
- Nausea and vomiting
- Diarrhea or constipation
Chemo can also affect the blood-forming cells of the bone marrow, which can lead to:
- Increased chance of infections (from low white blood cell counts)
- Easy bruising or bleeding (from low blood platelet counts)
- Fatigue (from low red blood cell counts)
These side effects usually go away after treatment is finished. There are often ways to lessen these side effects. For example, drugs can be given to help prevent or reduce nausea and vomiting.

---START CHUNK 2060---
These side effects usually go away after treatment is finished. There are often ways to lessen these side effects. For example, drugs can be given to help prevent or reduce nausea and vomiting.
Some drugs can have specific side effects. For example, drugs such as cisplatin, vinorelbine, docetaxel, or paclitaxel can cause nerve damage (peripheral neuropathy). This can sometimes lead to symptoms (mainly in the hands and feet), such as pain, burning or tingling sensations, sensitivity to cold, or weakness. In most people, this goes away or gets better once treatment is stopped, but it might last a long time in others.
Be sure to report any side effects you notice during chemo to your cancer care team so that they can be treated promptly. In some cases, the doses of the chemo drugs may need to be reduced or treatment may need to be delayed or stopped to keep the side effects from getting worse.

Section: Treatment Choices for Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer, by Stage

The treatment options for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) are based mainly on the stage (extent) of the cancer, but other factors, such as a person’s overall health and lung function, as well as certain traits of the cancer itself, are also important.
If you smoke: One of the most important things you can do to be ready for treatment is to try to quit. Studies have shown that people who stop smoking after a diagnosis of lung cancer tend to have better outcomes than those who don’t.

For these cancers, malignant cells are seen on sputum cytology, but no obvious tumor can be found with bronchoscopy or imaging tests. They are usually early-stage cancers. Bronchoscopy and possibly other tests are usually repeated every few months to look for a tumor. If a tumor is found, treatment will depend on the stage.

Section: Treatment Choices for Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer, by Stage > Treating stage 0 NSCLC

Because stage 0 NSCLC is limited to the lining layer of the airways and has not invaded deeper into the lung tissue or other areas, it is usually curable by surgery alone. No chemotherapy or radiation therapy is needed.
If you are healthy enough for surgery, you can usually be treated by segmentectomy or wedge resection (removal of part of the lobe of the lung). Cancers in some locations (such as where the windpipe divides into the left and right main bronchi) may be treated with a sleeve resection, but in some cases, they may be hard to remove completely without removing a lobe (lobectomy) or even an entire lung (pneumonectomy).
For some stage 0 cancers, treatments such as photodynamic therapy (PDT), laser therapy, or brachytherapy (internal radiation) may be alternatives to surgery.

Section: Treatment Choices for Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer, by Stage > Treating stage I NSCLC

---START CHUNK 2078---
If you have stage I NSCLC, surgery may be the only treatment you need. Surgery will either take out the lobe of the lung that has the tumor (lobectomy) or take out a smaller piece of the lung (sleeve resection, segmentectomy, or wedge resection). At least some lymph nodes in the lung and in the space between the lungs will also be removed and checked for cancer.
Segmentectomy or wedge resection is generally an option only for very small stage I cancers and for patients with other health problems that make removing the entire lobe dangerous. Still, most surgeons believe it is better to do a lobectomy if the patient can tolerate it, as it offers the best chance for cure.
For people with stage I NSCLC that has a higher risk of coming back (based on size, location, or other factors), chemotherapy, immunotherapy, and possibly targeted therapy (ie. alectinib, osimertinib) after surgery may lower the risk that cancer will return. This is called adjuvant treatment.

---START CHUNK 2079---
After surgery, the removed tissue is checked to see if there are cancer cells at the edges of the surgery specimen (called positive margins). This could mean that some cancer has been left behind, so a second surgery might be done to try to ensure that all the cancer has been removed (this might be followed by chemotherapy as well). Another option might be to use radiation therapy after surgery.
If you have serious health problems that prevent you from having surgery, you may get stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) or another type of radiation therapy as your main treatment. Ablation may be another option if the tumor is small and you are not able to undergo surgery.

Section: Treatment Choices for Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer, by Stage > Treating stage II NSCLC

---START CHUNK 2081---
Neoadjuvant (pre-operative) chemotherapy with or without immunotherapy is usually offered to patients with stage II NSCLC. After neoadjuvant therapy, people who have stage II NSCLC and are healthy enough for surgery usually have the cancer removed by lobectomy or sleeve resection. Sometimes removing the whole lung (pneumonectomy) is needed.
Any lymph nodes likely to have cancer in them are also removed. The extent of lymph node involvement and whether or not cancer cells are found at the edges of the removed tissues are important factors when planning the next step of treatment.

---START CHUNK 2082---
After surgery, the removed tissue is checked to see if there are cancer cells at the edges of the surgery specimen. This might mean that some cancer has been left behind, so a second surgery might be done to try to remove any remaining cancer. This may be followed by additional treatment with either chemotherapy, targeted therapy (ie. alectinib, osimertinib), or immunotherapy (ie. nivolumab, atezolizumab, pembrolizumab, durvalumab).

Section: Treatment Choices for Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer, by Stage > Treating stage IIIA NSCLC

---START CHUNK 2084---
The initial treatment for stage IIIA NSCLC may include some combination of radiation therapy, chemotherapy (chemo), immunotherapy, and/or surgery. For this reason, planning treatment for stage IIIA NSCLC often requires input from a medical oncologist, radiation oncologist, and a thoracic surgeon. Your treatment options depend on the size of the tumor, where it is in your lung, which lymph nodes it has spread to, your overall health, and how well you are tolerating treatment.
For stage IIIA lung cancers that is not able to be surgically removed, treatment usually starts with chemo, often combined with radiation therapy (called chemoradiation). After chemoradiation is completed, if the lung cancer has a certain EGFR mutation, adjuvant therapy with osimertinib may be recommended.

---START CHUNK 2085---
For certain stage IIIA cancers, surgery may be an option. Treatment usually starts with chemotherapy with or without immunotherapy or chemoradiation, followed by surgery, if the doctor thinks any remaining cancer can be removed and the patient is healthy enough. Additional therapy after surgery (adjuvant therapy) might be needed depending on what is found during surgery. Options for adjuvant therapy include chemotherapy, targeted therapy (ie. alectinib, osimertinib) and/or immunotherapy (ie. nivolumab).
If surgery, radiation, and chemoradiation are not likely to be good treatment options, treatment with an immunotherapy drug such as pembrolizumab (Keytruda) or cemiplimab (Libtayo) may be considered first.

Section: Treatment Choices for Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer, by Stage > Treating stage IIIB NSCLC

---START CHUNK 2087---
Stage IIIB NSCLC has spread to lymph nodes that are near the other lung or in the neck, and may also have grown into important structures in the chest. These cancers can’t be removed completely by surgery.
As with other stages of lung cancer, treatment depends on the patient’s overall health. If you are in fairly good health you may be helped by chemotherapy (chemo) combined with radiation therapy (known as chemoradiation). Additional therapy after chemoradiation may be needed such as targeted therapy (ie. Osimertinib if cancer cells have the EGFR mutation) or immunotherapy (ie. durvalumab, which can be given for up to a year to help keep the cancer stable).

---START CHUNK 2088---
Patients who are not healthy enough for this combination are often treated with radiation therapy alone, or, less often, chemo alone. If surgery, radiation, and chemoradiation aren’t likely to be good treatment options, an immunotherapy drug such as pembrolizumab (Keytruda) or cemiplimab (Libtayo) may be considered as the first treatment.
These cancers can be hard to treat, so taking part in a clinical trial of newer treatments may be a good option for some people.

Section: Treatment Choices for Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer, by Stage > Treating stage IVA and IVB NSCLC

Stage IVA or IVB NSCLC has already spread when it is diagnosed. These cancers can be very hard to cure. Treatment options depend on where and how far the cancer has spread, whether the cancer cells have certain gene or protein changes, and your overall health.
If you are in otherwise good health, treatments such as surgery, chemotherapy (chemo), targeted therapy, immunotherapy, and radiation therapy may help you live longer and make you feel better by relieving symptoms, even though they aren’t likely to cure you.
Other treatments, such as photodynamic therapy (PDT) or laser therapy, may also be used to help relieve symptoms. In any case, if you are going to be treated for advanced NSCLC, be sure you understand the goals of treatment before you start.

Section: Treatment Choices for Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer, by Stage > Treating stage IVA and IVB NSCLC > NSCLC that has spread to only one other site (stage IVA)

Cancer that is limited in the lungs and has only spread to one other site (such as the brain) is not common, but it can sometimes be treated (and even potentially cured) with surgery and/or radiation therapy to treat the area of cancer spread, followed by treatment of the cancer in the lung. For example, a single tumor in the brain may be treated with surgery or stereotactic radiation, or surgery followed by radiation to the whole brain. Treatment for the lung tumor is then based on its T and N stages, and may include surgery, chemo, radiation, or some of these in combination.

Section: Treatment Choices for Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer, by Stage > Treating stage IVA and IVB NSCLC > NSCLC that has spread widely (stage IVB)

---START CHUNK 2093---
For cancers that have spread widely throughout the body, before any treatments start, your tumor will be tested for certain gene mutations (such as in the KRAS, EGFR, ALK, ROS1, BRAF, RET, MET, or NTRK genes). If one of these genes is mutated in your cancer cells, your first treatment will likely be a targeted therapy drug.
Your tumor cells might also be tested for the PD-L1 protein. Tumors with higher levels of PD-L1 are more likely to respond to certain immunotherapy drugs (known as immune checkpoint inhibitors), which might be an option either alone or along with chemo.
If the cancer has caused fluid buildup in the space around the lungs (a malignant pleural effusion), the fluid may be drained. If it keeps coming back, options include pleurodesis or placement of a catheter into the chest through the skin to let the fluid drain out. (Details of these are discussed in Palliative Procedures for Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer.)

---START CHUNK 2094---
As with other stages, treatment for stage IV lung cancer depends on a person’s overall health. For example, some people not in good health might get only 1 chemo drug instead of 2. For people who can’t have chemo, radiation therapy is usually the treatment of choice. Local treatments such as laser therapy, PDT, or stent placement may also be used to help relieve symptoms caused by lung tumors.
Because treatment is unlikely to cure these cancers, taking part in a clinical trial of newer treatments may be a good option.
You can also find more information about living with stage IV cancer in Advanced Cancer.

Section: Treatment Choices for Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer, by Stage > NSCLC that progresses or recurs after treatment

---START CHUNK 2096---
If cancer continues to grow during treatment (progresses) or comes back (recurs), further treatment will depend on the location and extent of the cancer, what treatments have been used, and on the person’s health and desire for more treatment. It’s important to understand the goal of any further treatment – if it is to try to cure the cancer, to slow its growth, or to help relieve symptoms. It's also important to understand the benefits and risks.
Smaller cancers that recur locally in the lungs can sometimes be treated again with surgery or radiation therapy (if it hasn’t been used before).
Cancers that recur in the lymph nodes between the lungs are usually treated with chemo, possibly along with radiation if it hasn’t been used before.
For cancers that return at distant sites, chemo, targeted therapies, and/or immunotherapy are often the treatments of choice. A device that creates electric fields in the tumor might be an option, along with either immunotherapy or chemo.

---START CHUNK 2097---
For more on dealing with a recurrence, see Understanding Recurrence.
In some people, the cancer may never go away completely. These people may get regular treatments with chemo, radiation therapy, or other therapies to try to help keep the cancer in check. Learning to live with cancer that does not go away can be difficult and very stressful. It has its own type of uncertainty. Managing Cancer as a Chronic Illness talks more about this.

A lung nodule is a small (≤ 3 cm) abnormal area that is sometimes found during a CT scan of the chest and/or abdomen.

Section: Lung Nodules > If you have a lung nodule

---START CHUNK 2110---
Frequently, CT scans of the lung and/or abdomen are done that are not related to lung cancer screening or to diagnose lung cancer in patients who already have lung symptoms. These reasons include trauma, heart disease, non-cancer related lung disease, or lung infection. Lung nodules that are found on these scans are called “incidental pulmonary nodules.” In contrast, lung nodules that are found on lung cancer screening scans (i.e., LDCT) are not called incidental pulmonary nodules, and are managed differently.
Most lung nodules seen on CT scans are not cancer. They are more often the result of old infections, scar tissue, or other causes. But tests are often needed to be sure a nodule is not cancer.

---START CHUNK 2111---
Most lung nodules seen on CT scans are not cancer. They are more often the result of old infections, scar tissue, or other causes. But tests are often needed to be sure a nodule is not cancer.
Most often, the next step is to get a repeat CT scan to see if the nodule is growing over time. The time between scans might range anywhere from a few months to a year, depending on how likely your doctor thinks that the nodule could be cancer. This is based on the size, shape, and location of the nodule, as well as whether it appears to be solid or hazy. If a repeat scan shows that the nodule has grown, your doctor might also want to get another type of imaging test called a positron emission tomography (PET) scan, which can often help tell if it is cancer.
If later scans show that the nodule has grown, or if the nodule has other concerning features, your doctor will want to get a sample of it to check it for cancer cells. This is called a biopsy. This can be done in different ways:

---START CHUNK 2112---
- The doctor might pass a long, thin tube (called a bronchoscope) down your throat and into the airways of your lung to reach the nodule. A small tweezer on the end of the bronchoscope can be used to get a sample of the nodule.
- If the nodule is in the outer part of the lung, the doctor might pass a thin, hollow needle through the skin of the chest wall (with the guidance of a CT scan) and into the nodule to get a sample.
- If there is a higher chance that the nodule is cancer (or if the nodule can’t be reached with a needle or bronchoscope), surgery might be done to remove the nodule and some surrounding lung tissue. Sometimes larger parts of the lung might be removed as well.
These types of tests, biopsies, and surgeries are described in more detail in Tests for Lung Cancer.

Section: Lung Nodules > After the biopsy

---START CHUNK 2114---
After a biopsy is done, the tissue sample will be looked at closely in the lab by a doctor called a pathologist. The pathologist will check the biopsy for cancer, infection, scar tissue, and other lung problems. If cancer is found, then special tests will be done to find out what kind of cancer it is. If something other than cancer is found, the next step will depend on the diagnosis. Some nodules will be followed with a repeat CT scan in 6-12 months for a few years to make sure it does not change. If the lung nodule biopsy shows an infection, you might be sent to a specialist called an infectious disease doctor, for further testing and treatment. Your doctor will decide on the next step, depending on the results of the biopsy.

Screening is the use of tests or exams to find a disease in people who don’t have symptoms.

Section: Can Lung Cancer Be Found Early? > Screening options for lung cancer

Regular chest x-rays have been studied as a screening test for people at higher risk for lung cancer, but they haven’t been shown to help most people live longer, and therefore they aren’t recommended for lung cancer screening.
At present, a test known as a low-dose CT (LDCT) scan is used to screen people at higher risk (mainly because they smoke or used to smoke) for lung cancer. LDCT scans can help find abnormal areas in the lungs that may be cancer. Research has shown that unlike chest x-rays, yearly LDCT scans to screen people at higher risk of lung cancer can save lives. For these people, getting yearly LDCT scans before symptoms start helps lower the risk of dying from lung cancer.

Section: Can Lung Cancer Be Found Early? > Reasons to screen people at higher risk for lung cancer

---START CHUNK 2129---
In the United States, lung cancer is the second most common cancer. It’s also the leading cause of death from cancer.
If lung cancer is found at an earlier stage, when it is small and before it has spread, it is more likely to be treated successfully. Lung cancer screening is recommended for certain people who smoke or used to smoke, but who don't have any signs or symptoms.
Usually symptoms of lung cancer don’t appear until the disease is already at an advanced stage. Even when lung cancer does cause symptoms, many people may mistake them for other problems, such as an infection or long-term effects from smoking. This may delay the diagnosis. If you have symptoms that could be from lung cancer, see your doctor right away. (People who already have symptoms that might be from lung cancer may need tests such as CT scans to find the cause, which in some cases may be cancer. But this kind of testing is for diagnosis and is not the same as screening.)

Section: Can Lung Cancer Be Found Early? > American Cancer Society lung cancer screening guideline

---START CHUNK 2131---
The American Cancer Society recommends yearly screening for lung cancer with a low-dose CT (LDCT) scan for people ages 50 to 80 years who:
- Smoke or used to smoke
AND
- Have at least a 20 pack-year history of smoking
A pack-year is equal to smoking 1 pack (or about 20 cigarettes) per day for a year. For example, a person could have a 20 pack-year history by smoking 1 pack a day for 20 years, or by smoking 2 packs a day for 10 years.
Before deciding to be screened, people should have a discussion with a health care professional about the purpose of screening and how it is done, as well as the benefits, limits, and possible harms of screening.
People who still smoke should be counseled about quitting and offered interventions and resources to help them.
People should not be screened if they have serious health problems that will likely limit how long they will live, or if they won’t be able to or won’t want to get treatment if lung cancer is found.

Section: Can Lung Cancer Be Found Early? > American Cancer Society lung cancer screening guideline > Benefits and possible risks of lung cancer screening

---START CHUNK 2133---
The main benefit of screening is finding the cancer earlier and thus, lowering the chance of dying from lung cancer.
As with any type of screening, it’s important to be aware that, not everyone who gets screened will benefit. Screening with LDCT will not find all lung cancers. Not all of the cancers that are found will be found at an early stage. Some people with lung cancer that is found by screening will still die from that cancer.
LDCT scans can also find things that turn out not to be cancer, but that still have to be checked out with more tests to know what they are. You might need more CT scans, or less often, invasive tests such as a lung biopsy, in which a piece of lung tissue is removed with a needle or during surgery. These tests may lead to serious complications, but they rarely do.

---START CHUNK 2134---
LDCTs also expose people to a small amount of radiation with each test. It is less than the dose from a standard CT, but it is more than the dose from a chest x-ray. Some people who are screened may end up needing further CT scans, which means more radiation exposure.

Section: Can Lung Cancer Be Found Early? > American Cancer Society lung cancer screening guideline > Other things to consider if you’re thinking about screening

---START CHUNK 2136---
If you are at higher risk for lung cancer, your doctor can explain your risk and how lung cancer screening might apply to you. Your doctor can also talk with you about what happens during screening and the best places to get the yearly screening test. Lung cancer screening is covered by Medicare and by many private health insurance plans. Your health care team can help you find out if your insurance will provide coverage.
Screening should only be done at facilities that have the right type of CT scanner and that have experience in LDCT scans for lung cancer screening. The facility should also have a team of specialists that can give patients the appropriate care and follow-up if there are abnormal results on the scans. You might not have the right kind of facility nearby, so you may need to travel some distance to be screened.

---START CHUNK 2137---
If you smoke, you might want to get counseling about stopping. You should be told about your risk of lung cancer and referred to a smoking cessation program. Screening is not a good alternative to stopping smoking. By quitting, people who smoke can lower their risk of getting and dying from lung cancer. For help quitting, see How to Quit Using Tobacco or call the American Cancer Society at 1-800-227-2345.
To get the most benefit from screening, people need to be in fairly good health. For example, they need to be healthy enough to  have surgery and receive other treatments if lung cancer is found. People who have major health issues that could keep them from having lung surgery might not be good candidates for lung cancer screening. The same is true for people who might have a shortened life expectancy because they already have other serious medical conditions. These people might not benefit enough from screening for it to be worth the risks.

---START CHUNK 2138---
It’s important to talk to your doctor about all your health issues when deciding if lung cancer screening is right for you.

Section: Can Lung Cancer Be Found Early? > How screening is done

---START CHUNK 2140---
Screening for lung cancer is done with a yearly low-dose CT scan (LDCT). For this test, you lie on a thin, flat table that slides back and forth inside the hole in the middle of the CT scanner, which is a large, doughnut-shaped machine.
As the table moves into the opening, an x-ray tube rotates within the scanner, sending out many tiny x-ray beams at precise angles. These beams quickly pass through your body and are detected on the other side of the scanner. A computer then converts these results into detailed images of the lungs.
An LDCT scan is painless and only takes a few minutes, although the entire visit (including getting you ready and into place on the table) can take up to half an hour. You don’t need to swallow anything or get any type of injection before this type of CT scan. LDCT does expose you to a small amount of radiation, although it is less than that from a standard CT scan.
To learn more about CT scans and what getting one is like, see CT Scan for Cancer.

Section: Can Lung Cancer Be Found Early? > How screening is done > If something abnormal is found during screening

Sometimes screening tests will show something abnormal in the lungs or nearby areas. Most of these abnormal findings will turn out not to be cancer, but more CT scans or other tests will be needed to be sure. Some of these tests are described in Tests for Lung Cancer.
CT scans of the lungs can also sometimes show problems in other organs near the lungs. Your doctor will discuss any such findings with you if they are found.

Section: Palliative Procedures for Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer > Options for palliative support

People with lung cancer often benefit from procedures to help with problems caused by the cancer. For example, people with advanced lung cancer can have shortness of breath. This can be caused by a number of things, including fluid around the lung or an airway that is blocked by a tumor. Although treating the cancer with chemotherapy or other drugs may help with this over time, other treatments may be needed as well.

Pleurodesis is a procedure done to remove the fluid and keep it from coming back. The 2 main types are:
Chemical pleurodesis: A small cut is made in the skin of the chest wall, and a hollow tube (called a chest tube) is placed into the chest to remove the fluid. Then a substance is put into the chest through the tube that causes the linings of the lung (visceral pleura) and chest wall (parietal pleura) to stick together, sealing the space and limiting further fluid buildup. A number of substances can be used for this, such as talc, the antibiotic doxycycline, or a chemotherapy drug like bleomycin.
Surgical pleurodesis: Talc is blown into the space around the lungs during an operation. This is done using thoracoscopy through a small incision.

Section: Palliative Procedures for Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer > Treating an airway blocked by a tumor > Photodynamic therapy (PDT)

---START CHUNK 2166---
This type of treatment can be used to treat very early-stage lung cancers that are only in the outer layers of the lung airways, when other treatments aren’t appropriate. It can also be used to help open up airways blocked by tumors to help people breathe better.
For this technique, a light-activated drug called porfimer sodium (Photofrin) is injected into a vein. This drug collects more in cancer cells than in normal cells. After a couple of days (to give the drug time to build up in the cancer cells), a bronchoscope is passed down the throat and into the lung. This can be done with either local anesthesia (numbing the throat) and sedation, or with general anesthesia (where you are in a deep sleep). A special laser light on the end of the bronchoscope is aimed at the tumor, which activates the drug and causes the cells to die. The dead cells are then removed a few days later during a bronchoscopy. This process can be repeated if needed.

---START CHUNK 2167---
PDT can cause swelling in the airway for a few days, which may lead to some shortness of breath, as well as coughing up blood or thick mucus. Some of this drug also collects in normal cells in the body, such as skin and eye cells. This can make you very sensitive to sunlight or strong indoor lights. Too much exposure can cause serious skin reactions (like a severe sunburn), so doctors recommend staying out of any strong light for several weeks after the injection.
For more information on PDT, see Photodynamic Therapy.

Lasers can sometimes be used to treat very small tumors in the linings of airways. They can also be used to help open up airways blocked by larger tumors to help people breathe better.
The laser is on the end of a bronchoscope, which is passed down the throat and next to the tumor. The doctor then aims the laser beam at the tumor to burn it away. This treatment can usually be repeated, if needed. You are usually asleep (under general anesthesia) for this type of treatment.

Section: Tumor Treating Fields (TTF) Therapy for Non-small Cell Lung Cancer

Researchers have found that exposing some types of cancer cells to alternating electric fields, also known as tumor treating fields (or TTFields), can interfere with the cells’ ability to grow and spread.
A wearable device known as Optune Lua is a TTFields treatment that creates such electric fields. It is an option to help treat some people with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).

Author: American Cancer Society

Section: Tumor Treating Fields (TTF) Therapy for Non-small Cell Lung Cancer > When might TTFields be used to treat NSCLC?

Optune Lua can be used along with either an immune checkpoint inhibitor or with the chemotherapy drug docetaxel to treat some people with metastatic NSCLC that has grown during or after treatment with chemotherapy.

Section: Tumor Treating Fields (TTF) Therapy for Non-small Cell Lung Cancer > How is TTFields therapy given?

For this treatment, the chest and/or back is shaved (if needed), and pads containing sets of electrodes are placed on the skin, usually 2 on the chest and 2 on the back.
The electrodes are attached to a battery pack (kept in a backpack) and are worn for most of the day - typically at least 18 hours. They create mild electric currents that are thought to affect cancer cells more than normal cells.
